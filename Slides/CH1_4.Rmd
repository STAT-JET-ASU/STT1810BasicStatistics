## Learning Goals for Chapter 1

> * Use the chance model to determine whether an observed statistic is unlikely to occur. [Section 1.1]
> * Calculate and interpret a *p*-value, and state the strength of evidence it provides against the null hypothesis. [Section 1.2]
> * Calculate a standardized statistic for a single proportion and evaluate the strength of evidence it provides against a null hypothesis. [Section 1.3]
> * Describe how the distance of the observed statistic from the parameter value specified by the null hypothesis, sample size, and one- vs. two-sided tests affect the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. [Section 1.4]

We will *not* be covering Section 1.5, which discusses the theory-based approach to inference for a single proportion.


## Learning Goals for Section 1.4

* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is smaller when the observed proportion of successes is farther away from the hypothesized value of the long-run proportion of successes.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is smaller when the sample size is larger.
* Recognize when a two-sided test / alternative hypothesis is suggested by the research question.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is larger when the alternative hypothesis is two-sided.


## Section 1.4 New Vocabulary

**two-sided test / alternative hypothesis:** a test of significance in which the alternative hypothesis Ha has the form "not equal to" or "does not equal" (≠) rather than less or greater (< or >). 

***Example:*** Our online ESP test mentions both "psi-hitting" (getting more cards correct than expected by chance) and "psi-missing" (getting fewer correct). If we are interested in either of the two possibilities, we would write our hypotheses as follows.

$$H_0: \pi = 0.20$$

$$H_a: \pi \neq 0.20$$

In this case, "extreme" would be measured on *both* sides of the null distribution, not just the upper side like $H_a: \pi > 0.20$.


## What Impacts Strength of Evidence?

Three important components of a test of significance influence the strength provided by the data evidence.

* **extremeness:** The farther away the observed statistic is from the average value of the null distribution (i.e., the value that is specified for  $\pi$ in Ho), the more evidence there is against $H_0$.

* **sample size:** As the sample size increases (while the values of the observed sample statistic $\hat{p}$ and $H_a$ stay the same) the strength of evidence against $H_0$ increases.

* **one- vs. two-tailed Ha:** Because the *p*-value for a two-sided test is about twice as large as we would get for a one-sided test using the same data, it provides less evidence against $H_0$. (*Two-sided tests are used more often in scientific practice.*)


## Flashback: [ESP Test](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Slides/STT1810/ESPZenerCards.html)

***Example:*** We can use the [One Proportion Applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to assess the statistical significance of our Zener card ESP test results from earlier in the semester. 

$$H_o: \pi = 0.20$$

$$H_a: \pi > 0.20$$

Let's say my results were 6 out of 25 cards correct.

> * What is the *p*-value for this particular test result?
> * What if I'd scored 9 correct instead of 6 on the test?
> * What if I'd done a test with 50 cards and got 12 right?
> * What if I'd tested for both psi-hitting and psi-missing? 


## 

**INITIAL:** I got 6 of 25 cards correct on my ESP test, so $\hat{p} = 0.24$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OneProportionAppletZenerA.png", dpi = 150)
```


## 

⬤ I got 9 of 25 cards correct, so $n$ is still $25$, but now $\hat{p} = 0.36$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OneProportionAppletZenerB.png", dpi = 150)
```


## 

⬤ I got 12 of 50 cards correct, so $\hat{p}$ is still $0.24$, but now $n = 50$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OneProportionAppletZenerC.png", dpi = 150)
```


## 

⬤ I used a *two*-sided hypothesis instead of *one* on the initial test.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```


## Summary of Results

Each case changes one input from the baseline test. The table shows the predicted increases or decreases in the *p*-values. We always have the same $H_0$ (*results are due to random chance*).

| null             | alternative         | $n$ | $\hat{p}$ | *p*-value | change      |
|:----------------:|:-------------------:|:---:|:---------:|:---------:|:-----------:| 
| $H_0:\pi = 0.20$ | $H_a:\pi > 0.20$    | 25  | 0.24      | 0.3810    | (baseline)  |   
| $H_0:\pi = 0.20$ | $H_a:\pi > 0.20$    | 25  | 0.36      | 0.0490    | extremeness |
| $H_0:\pi = 0.20$ | $H_a:\pi > 0.20$    | 50  | 0.24      | 0.2850    | sample size |
| $H_0:\pi = 0.20$ | $H_a:\pi \neq 0.20$ | 25  | 0.24      | 0.6173    | alternative |

Remember: Smaller *p*-values provide *more* evidence against $H_0$.

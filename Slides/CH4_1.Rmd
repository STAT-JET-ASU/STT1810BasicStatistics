* We addressed *strength* of evidence (significance) in Chapter 1.

* We addressed the  *breadth* of results (generalization) in Chapter 2.

* We addressed the *size* of an effect (estimation) in Chapter 3.

* Chapter 4 introduces the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 4

Chapter 4 focuses on ***causation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Overall, the main goal is to explain *when* and *why* we can infer cause-and-effect after we determine there is an ***association*** between two variables. 

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies. [Section 4.1]
* Explain how studies using random assignment are able to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. [Section 4.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 4.1

* Calculate and interpret conditional proportions.
* Interpret conditional proportions as to whether they give any indication of an association between the explanatory and response variables.
* Identify which variable is the explanatory variable and which is response in a study involving two variables.
* Identify potential confounding variables and explain how they provide an alternative explanation for the observed association between the explanatory variable and the response variable.
* Draw a diagram to show how the confounding variable provides an alternative explanation for the observed association between the explanatory variable and the response variable.


## Section 4.1 New Vocabulary

* **associated:** two variables are associated or related to each other if the distribution of one variable is different across the values of the other variable

* **explanatory variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that explains changes in the response variable (also known as the **independent** / **predictor variable**). 

* **response variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that is impacted by the explanatory variable (also known as the **dependent variable**)

* **confounding variable:** a variable that is related to both the explanatory and response variables in such a way that its effects on the response variable cannot be separated from those of the explanatory variable


## Uncovering Relationships

Alternative definition: two variables are *associated* (or related) if the value of one variable gives you information about the value of the other variable. When comparing groups, the proportions (or means) of one variable (e.g., the proposed response variable) are different within different groups (e.g., different categories of the independent variable).

## Example 4.1 Nightlights and Myopia

Myopia, or nearsightedness, typically develops during childhood years. Is there an association between myopia and use of night lights? One study interviewed parents of 479 children and asked whether the child slept with the room light on, with a night light on, or in darkness before age two. Children were also separated into two groups: nearsighted or not nearsighted.

* **observational units:** individual children
* **explanatory variable:** intensity of light in the room when the child slept prior to age two; categorical and *non*-binary (three different categories)
* **response variable:** whether or not the child had myopia (i.e., was nearsighted); categorical and binary
* **sample size:** $n$ = 479


## The Observed Data

We can display the study data in a *contingency table*. This shows the number of children who fall into each combination of the two variables; for example, nearsighted *and* slept in darkness. We can also see the total for each variable alone in the *margins* of the table (far right column and bottom row).


|                 | Darkness | Night Light | Room Light |    Total |
|-----------------|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Nearsighted     |       18 |          78 |         41 |      137 |
| Not Nearsighted |      154 |         154 |         34 |      342 |
| Total           |      172 |         232 |         75 |      479 |


<br>*But*...counts can be difficult to interpret in terms of associations.


##

We can calculate percentages of children with nearsightedness *conditional* on the amount of light in the room at night. 

|                 | Darkness | Night Light | Room Light |    Total |
|-----------------|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Nearsighted     |    10.5% |       33.6% |      54.7% |    28.6% |
| Not Nearsighted |    89.5% |       66.4% |      45.3% |    71.4% |
| Total           |     100% |        100% |       100% |     100% |

<br>

There is higher percentage of nearsighted children among those using a room light (54.7%) or with a night light (33.6%) compared to children who slept in darkness (10.5%). The variables (amount of light and eye condition) are *associated*---probability of having myopia is different for the three amounts of light.


## Alternative Explanation #1

A *confounding varible* is related to the explanatory and response variables in such a way that its effects on the response variable cannot be separated from those of the explanatory variable. In this case, myopia is often inherited from parents (so **genetics** is a possible confound). Maybe these parents are also more likely to use a room light or a night light for their kids.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_04_01_01.jpg", dpi = 150)
```


## Alternative Explanation #2

This is an observational study (we will see this again in Section 4.2) with data taken after the fact. That means that even if we find an association, it does not mean there is *cause and effect*. The direction of the relationship might even be the opposite of what we first expect.

In this case, maybe children who are already developing myopia (i.e., starting to get nearsighted) are more likely to want to sleep with some kind of light in their rooms. 

<hr>

Can you think of any other confounding variables or alternative explanations for the association? *Recall that researchers chose to interview the parents of children who were patients in a university pediatric ophthalmology clinic, as a start...*

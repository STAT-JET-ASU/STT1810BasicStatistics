## Before We Begin…

These slides are intended to accompany Section 4.2 Observational Studies Versus Experiments in [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html). 

*This content does not replace reading the textbook section.* It is for class presentation and/or reference.

* We addressed *strength* of evidence (**significance)** in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Great job!***

* We addressed the  *breadth* of results (**generalization**) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Great job!***

* We addressed the *size* for an effect (**estimation**) in Chapter 3. ✔ ***Great job!***

* &#187; Chapter 4 introduces the idea of **causation**, the last of the four pillars. &#171;

## Learning Goals for Chapter 4

Chapter 4 focuses on ***causation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Overall, the main goal is to explain *when* and *why* we can infer cause-and-effect after we determine there is an ***association*** between two variables. 

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies. [Section 4.1]
* Explain how studies using random assignment are able to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. [Section 4.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 4.2

* Identify a study as observational or experimental.
* Explain that random assignment gives us the ability to draw cause–effect conclusions because it ensures that treatment groups have similar characteristics.
* Identify whether a study uses random assignment and/or random sampling and the implications of these design decisions on the conclusions that can be drawn.
* Describe what a block study design is and the benefits of using a blocking variable.


## Review Section 4.1 Vocabulary

**associated:** two variables are associated or related to each other if the distribution of one variable is different across the values of the other variable

**explanatory variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that explains changes in the response variable (also known as the **independent** / **predictor variable**). 

**response variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that is impacted by the explanatory variable (also known as the **dependent variable**)

**confounding variable:** a variable that is related to both the explanatory and response variables in such a way that its effects on the response variable cannot be separated from those of the explanatory variable


## Section 4.2 New Vocabuary

* block study design
* cause and effect
* control
* double blind
* experiment
* experimental unit
* observational study
* quasi-experiment
* randomized experiment
* treatment


## 

**observational study:** study in which the researchers observe individuals and measure variables of interest, but they do not intervene in order to attempt to influence responses

***Examples:*** Example P.2, where we investigated how long it takes performers to sing the national anthem; Exploration 3.1, where we analyzed whether people turn their heads left or right when they kiss. Researchers recorded "naturally occurring" data.

**experiment:** a study in which the researchers manipulate the explanatory variable and actively assign study participants (or subjects) to treatment groups

***Examples:*** In a clinical drug trial, the researchers assign some participants to try a new drug for allergies and the rest of the participants to a group that takes a similar-looking inactive pill. In a psychology study, participants are assigned to look at print ads or watch television commercials for candidates.


##

**treatment:** the assigned conditions/experimental groups in an experiment

**control:** a do-nothing or placebo treatment in an experiment

**randomized experiment:** a study where experimental units are randomly assigned to two or more treatment conditions and the explanatory variable is actively imposed on the subjects

**block study design (randomized block design):** a study design that begins by forming blocks consisting of individuals that are similar in some way that may be related to the response (a way that could be confounding); random assignment of treatments is then carried out separately with each block

***Example:*** Subjects in an allergy drug experiment are grouped by the severity of their allergies (mild, moderate, severe), then each group is randomized separately into the two treatments.

##

**quasi-experiment:** an experimental study in which researchers manipulate the explanatory variable, but not randomly

***Example:*** Researchers are studying three methods for stopping smoking (cold turkey, patch, and gum), but participants choose for themselves what method they use.

**experimental unit:** what observational units are often called in an experiment

**double blind:** a study design where neither the subjects nor those evaluating the response know which treatment group each subject is in (usually requires a placebo)

**cause and effect:** in a randomized experiment, we can conclude that the explanatory variable is causing the effect (difference or association) we see in the response variable (*the randomization balances possible confounding variables*)


## Example 4.2 Internet Lying

Are people more likely to tell lies with e-mail than with pencil and paper? A study reported at the August 2008 meeting of the Academy of Management involved 48 graduate students in business who participated in a “bargaining” game. Researchers kept track of whether students misrepresented (lied about) the size of the pot when they were negotiating with other players.

* **experimental units:** individual graduate students
* **explanatory variable:** communication method; categorical and binary
* **response variable:** whether the participant lied; categorical and binary
* **sample size:** $n$ = 48 overall, with $n_1$ = 26 in the e-mail group and $n_2$ = 22 in the paper and pencil group


## Study Design

The researchers randomly assigned the communication method used by each of the participants, so this study was a *randomized experiment*. Randomization theoretically creates group balance in a study with respect to possible confounding variables.

* *Suppose there were 30 male and 18 female subjects and all 30 men in the sample communicated via the Internet, while the 18 women used pencil and paper. If you were concerned that males might be more competitive and thus more likely to lie, how would this limit your ability to draw conclusions?*

In theory, given that this is a randomized experiment, if we find a difference in lying behavior between the Internet and pencil-and-paper players, there are only two explanations: (1) cause-and-effect relationship or (2) random chance from the random assignment process.


## Explore the Data

We compute the conditional proportions for those who lied in each of the experimental treatment groups.

|             |    E-Mail | Pencil / Paper |     Total |
|-------------|:---------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
| Did Not Lie |   2 (8%)  |        8 (36%) | 10 (21%)  |
| Lied        |  24 (92%) |       14 (64%) | 38 (79%)  |
| Total       | 26 (100%) |       22 (100%)| 48 (100%) |

<br>

Probability of lying, given e-mail communication: 0.92

Probability of lying, given paper-and-pencil communication: 0.64


## Draw Inferences

* Lying was common overall (79%), but lying was more likely in the e-mail group (92%) than the paper/pencil group (64%).

* One possible explanation for the results is that the format of the game influenced how people responded. They feel more comfortable lying in e-mail communication, perhaps because it seems anonymous. 

* Another possible explanation is random chance. We claimed that random assignment balanced the two groups, but there is still a chance that the random assignment process itself resulted in slightly different groups. (Notice the randomness we are considering here is from the random *assignment*, not random choices or random sampling.) 

* *A significance test would show that randomness is implausible.*


## Formulate Conclusions

* The study used random assignment to form the groups, so we don’t expect to have any systematic group differences at the start of the study.

* There is a statistically significant difference between the two groups at the end of the study.

* Therefore, a plausible explanation is that the observed effect is due to the treatment group to which the experimental units were assigned (*cause and effect*).

* However, the participants in this study were business school graduate students and volunteers, so we should be cautious about *generalizing* to a larger population. 

* It is common for experiments *not* to have random selection.


## Random *Selection* vs. *Assignment*

A “randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled experiment” is considered by some to be the gold standard in scientific studies.

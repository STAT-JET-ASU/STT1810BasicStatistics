* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we will look at comparing parameters for two groups ($\pi_1, \pi_2$).

* The investigative process is the same; the six-step "spiral" we introduced in Section P.1.

* Now Ho will be written as a *difference* in parameters.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. In this case, rather than testing a null hypothesis about whether $\pi$ is equal to some value, we will typically have a null of $H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2$ or $H_0: \pi_1 - \pi_2 = 0$ &rarr; there is *no difference*. 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample proportions numerically and graphically. [Section 5.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population proportions. [Section 5.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 5.1

* Organize counts into a two-way table, when data are available on two categorical variables for the same set of observational units.
* Calculate conditional proportion of successes, for different categories of the explanatory variable, and use these conditional proportions to decide whether there is preliminary evidence of an association between the explanatory and response variables.
* Create a segmented bar chart or mosaic plot to display data available on two categorical variables for the same set of observational units.
* Calculate and interpret relative risk.


## Section 5.1 New Vocabulary

* cells

* no association
* odds / odds ratio*

* segmented bar graph

* two-way table

##

**two-way table:** a tabular summary of two categorical variables, also called a contingency table

**cells:** the individual entries in a two-way table that show where the two variables intersect (not the row and column totals)

**two by two (2 × 2) table:** a two-way table where the explanatory and response variables each have two categories

**conditional proportion:** the proportion of successes for a given category of the explanatory variable, or its **probability**; in some contexts (e.g., health care literature) this value may be called the **absolute risk** for the given category

**no association:** a general statement of the null hypothesis when two or more variables are involved, indicating that two variables are not related to each other


##

**segmented bar graph:** a type of graph display for conditional proportions from a two-way table, with equal-width rectangles totaling 100% for each category of the independent variable, divided by the conditional proportions for the categories of the response variable

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

<div style = "font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">Survival Rates for Titanic Passengers by Sex</div>


##

An example with three variables...

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/titanicsurvival02.png", dpi = 175)
```

<div style = "font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">Survival Rates for Titanic Passengers by Sex and Class</div>


##

**mosaic plot:** a segmented bar plot where the widths of the bars are proportional to the sample size

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/titanicsurvival03.png", dpi = 230)
```

<div style = "font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">Survival Rates for Titanic Passengers by Sex</div>

<br>

There were more male than female passengers aboard Titanic.


## 

**relative risk:** the ratio of conditional proportions that indicates how many times greater the risk of an outcome is for one group compared to another group (also sometimes called **risk ratio**)

$$RR = \frac{\text{proportion (risk) in explanatory category 2}}{\text{proportion (risk) in explanatory category 1}}$$

***Example:*** Consider the incidence of oral cancer among smokers and non-smokers (smoking or not is the explanatory variable).

|Oral Cancer? | Non-Smoker | Smoker     |
|-------------|:----------:|:----------:|
| Yes         | 27 (23%)   | 484 (56%)  |
| No          | 90 (77%)   | 385 (44%)  |
| Total       | 117 (100%) | 869 (100%) |


##

We can calculate the relative risk or risk ratio.

$$RR = \frac{\text{oral cancer risk for smokers}}{\text{oral cancer risk for non-smokers}} = \frac{0.56}{0.23} = 2.43$$

According to the data, people who smoke are 2.43 times as likely to develop oral cancer as people who do not smoke.

$$RR = \frac{\text{oral cancer risk for non-smokers}}{\text{oral cancer risk for smokers}} = \frac{0.23}{0.56} = 0.41$$

The decimal value 0.41 is about 2/5, so we can say non-smokers are about two-fifths as likely to develop oral cancer as smokers.

These are equivalent expressions, but the first version might be more understandable. We just need to be clear how the groups are being compared when stating risk ratios.



## 

**percent increased risk:** this quantity re-expresses the absolute difference in risks as a fraction of the "baseline" risk

$$\%IR = \frac{\text{risk in category 2 - risk in category 1}}{\text{risk in category 1}} \times 100\%$$

We can also write this as a function of relative risk. First...

$$= \bigg( \frac{\text{risk in category 2}}{\text{risk in category 1}} - \frac{\text{risk in category 1}}{\text{risk in category 1}} \bigg) \times 100\%$$

Which simplifies to...

$$\%IR = (RR - 1) \times 100\%$$

***Example:*** Revisit the incidence of oral cancer among smokers and non-smokers (smoking or not is the explanatory variable).


##

If we let non-smokers be category 1...

$$\%IR = \frac{0.56 - 0.23}{0.23} \times 100\% = 143\%$$

The percent *change* or *increase* in the risk of oral cancer is 143% for smokers as compared to non-smokers (i.e., the risk went up by 143% of the original 23% probability; 23% + 1.43(23%) = 56%). 

What if we reverse the two groups?

$$\%IR = \frac{0.23 - 0.56}{0.56} \times 100\% = -59\%$$

A negative percent increased risk is a *decrease*. This should make sense---the risk of oral cancer is decreased if someone does *not* smoke, relative to smokers. In this case, risk decreases by more than half, from 56% to 23%.


##

**odds:** odds is similar to probability (risk), except that instead of looking at the fraction of times an event occurs out of the whole, odds is a ratio of how often an event happens versus how often it does not happen

***Example 1:*** The odds of getting a head versus a tail on a coin flip are 1:1 (for every 1 time a head occurs, we would expect 1 tail)

***Example 2:*** The odds of rolling 6 on a standard die are 1:5, since there are five outcomes that are not a 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

***Example 3:*** In the oral cancer example, odds of a smoker getting oral cancer are 484 to 385. If we divide both sides by the smaller number, the odds are about 1.26 to 1 --- for every 1 smoker who does not get oral cancer, about 1.26 will.

For the non-smokers, odds of getting cancer are 27 to 90 or 1 to 3.33. For every 1 nonsmoker who gets cancer, 3.33 will not.


##

**odds ratio:** odds ratio is similar to risk ratio, except using odds instead of risks; the odds are expressed as fractions in this case

$$OR = \frac{\text{odds in explanatory category 2}}{\text{odds in explanatory category 1}}$$

***Example:*** What is the odds ratio of oral cancer among smokers versus nonsmokers?

$$OR = \frac{\text{yes for smokers}/\text{no for smokers}}{\text{yes for non-smokers}/\text{no for non-smokers}}$$

$$= \frac{484/385}{\text{27/90}} = 4.2$$

The odds of oral cancer among smokers is 4.2 times the odds of oral cancer among non-smokers.

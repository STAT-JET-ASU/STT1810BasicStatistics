* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we will look at comparing parameters for two groups ($\pi_1, \pi_2$).

* The investigative process is the same; the six-step "spiral" we introduced in Section P.1.

* Now Ho will be written as a *difference* in parameters.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. In this case, rather than testing a null hypothesis about whether $\pi$ is equal to some value, we will typically have a null of $H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2$ or $H_0: \pi_1 - \pi_2 = 0$ &rarr; there is *no difference*. 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample proportions numerically and graphically. [Section 5.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population proportions. [Section 5.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 5.2

In Section 5.2 we are using all our statistical knowledge gained in Chapters 1 through 4 and applying it to a new scenario.

* State Ho and Ha in terms of “no association” versus “there is an association” as well as in terms of comparing probabilities of success for two categories of explanatory variable ($\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$) when exploring the relationship between two categorical variables.
* Implement the 3S strategy: find a statistic, simulate the null distribution, and compute the strength of evidence...
* Describe how to use cards to simulate what outcomes (in terms of difference in conditional proportions and/or relative risk) are to be expected in repeated random assignments, if there is no association between the two variables.


##

* Use the [ISI Two Proportions applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to conduct a simulation of the null hypothesis and be able to read the applet output.
* Find and interpret the standardized statistic and the *p*-value for a test of two proportions.
* Use the 2SD method to find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in long-run proportion of success for two “treatment” groups, and interpret the interval in the context of the study.
* Interpret what it means for the 95% confidence interval for difference in proportions to contain zero.
* State a complete conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis) based on the *p*-value and/or standardized statistic and the study design, including statistical significance, estimation (confidence interval), generalizability, and causation.


## Section 5.2 New Vocabulary

**standard error:** an estimate for the standard deviation of the null distribution of a statistic

<hr>

This vocabulary term is not completely new. We mentioned it in Section 2.1 when we explored sampling distributions, and then we encountered it again in Section 3.2 when we introduced 2SD confidence intervals.


## Example 5.2 Swimming with Dolphins

**Research Question:** Is swimming with dolphins therapeutic for patients suffering from clinical depression?

* **type of study:** randomized experiment (*possibly single blind*)

* **experimental units:** 30 recruited subjects aged 18–65 with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate depression

* **treatment groups:** (1) one hour of swimming and snorkling each day in the presence of bottlenose dolphins or (2) one hour of swimming and snorkling each day *without* dolphins (control group); categorical and binary

* **response variable:** whether the subjects achieved substantial reduction (i.e., improvement) in their depression symptoms, coded as yes/no; categorical and binary


## The Hypotheses: Two Expressions

**Using the association language of Chapter 4...**

* Ho: Presence of dolphins does not help (i.e., whether or not someone swims with dolphins has no association with their depression symptoms).
* Ha: Presence of dolphins helps (i.e., there *is* an association and swimming with dolphins will increase the probability of substantial improvement in depression symptoms).

<hr>

Hypotheses expressed in this form generally would be assessed with a procedure called a $\chi^2$ (chi-square) test, which is covered in Chapter 8 of the textbook. That test can compare two *or more* proportions---two-way tables that are larger than 2 x 2.


##

**Using parameters, as in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3...**

State hypotheses in words, based on the research question.

* Ho: probability of improvement after swimming with dolphins is the same as without dolphins.
* Ha: Probability of improvement after swimming with dolphins is greater than without dolphins.

<hr>

Now define two parameters in the context of the problem.

* $\pi_\text{control}$ = the probability of significant improvement after not swimming with dolphins

* $\pi_\text{dolphins}$ = the probability of significant improvement after swimming with dolphins


## Stating the Hypotheses With Symbols

As before, we can convert the words to symbols.

$$H_0: \pi_\text{dolphins} = \pi_\text{control}$$

$$H_a: \pi_\text{dolphins} > \pi_\text{control}$$

We are really interested in the *difference* between the groups, so the hypotheses can be expressed as a mathematical difference. Algebraically, subtract $\pi_\text{control}$ from both sides, and we get...

$$H_0: \pi_\text{dolphins} - \pi_\text{control} = 0$$

$$H_a: \pi_\text{dolphins} - \pi_\text{control} > 0$$

The observed statistic for this test will be ($\hat{p}_\text{dolphins} - \hat{p}_\text{control}$).


## Explore the Data

Compute conditional proportions of those who demonstrated a "substantial improvement" in symptoms after two weeks, within each treatment group.

| Substantial improvement? | Dolphin     | Control     | Total       |
|--------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Yes                      | 10 (66.67%) |  3 (20.00%) | 13 (43.33%) |
| No                       |  5 (33.33%) | 12 (80.00%) | 17 (56.67%) |
| Total                    | 15 (100%)   | 15 (100%)   | 30 (100%)   |

<br>

$$\hat{p}_\text{dolphins} - \hat{p}_\text{control} = 0.6667 - 0.2000 = 0.4667$$


## Visualize with a Barplot

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_05_02_01.jpg", dpi = 80)
```

Since the groups are equally sized ($n = 15$ each), the barplot and mosaic plot would be essentially the same.


## Draw Inferences

We can use the [ISI Two-Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to obtain a simulated *p*-value. The two groups are shuffled together and randomly re-divided between the two treatment groups. From the regrouped data we recalculate the statistic to get a null distribution. Where would the observed statistic be on this plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_05_02_05.jpg", dpi = 120)
```


## Assess Statistical Significance

Per the text, there were 13 simulated differences $\ge$ 0. 4667, so the *p*-value is 0.013, which provides strong evidence against Ho.

<hr>

Recall our guidelines for *p*-values from Section 1.2.

| Magnitude               | Guideline for Inference                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| *p*-value > 0.10        | not much evidence against the null hypothesis; Ho is plausible |
| 0.05 < *p*-value ≤ 0.10 | moderate evidence against the null hypothesis                  |
| 0.01 < *p*-value ≤ 0.05 | strong evidence against the null hypothesis                    |
| *p*-value ≤ 0.01        | very strong evidence against the null hypothesis               |


## 

$$\text{z-score} = \frac{\text{stat} - \text{mean of null dist.}}{\text{SD of null dist.}} = \frac{0.4667 - 0}{0.185} = 2.52$$

The standardized score provides strong evidence against Ho.

<hr>

Recall our guidelines for z-scores from Section 1.3.

| Magnitude                | Guideline for Inference                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| between -1.5 and +1.5    | not much evidence against Ho; Ho is plausible |
| below -1.5 or above +1.5 | moderate evidence against Ho                  |
| below -2.0 or above +2.0 | strong evidence against Ho                    |
| below -3.0 or above +3.0 | very strong evidence against Ho               |


## Estimate Magnitude of Difference

We can estimate the magnitude of the difference between two parameters with a confidence interval. Recall what we learned in Section 3.2, with a little modification...

$$\text{95% CI} = (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)  \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$$

Use the difference in sample proportions 0.4667 and simulated SD of the difference between sample proportions, 0.185.

$$0.4667 \pm 2 \times 0.185 = 0.4667 \pm 0.370$$

We are 95% confident that the estimated interval (0.097, 0.837) captures the true value of $\pi_\text{dolphins} - \pi_\text{control}$.

Notice that zero is not within the interval. This is consistent with rejecting Ho. Zero is not a plausible value for the difference.


## Recall: Random *Selection* vs. *Assignment*

In Section 4.2 we discussed the way that random selection and random assignment influence our determinations of cause and effect and generalization for a given study.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_04_02_03.jpg", dpi = 110)
```


## Conclusions / Generalizations

This study was a randomized experiment and the data provided strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we can conclude that swimming with dolphins caused a significant improvement in depression symptoms. 

The magnitude of the difference in patients showing significant improvement is somewhere between 9.7% and 83.7%.

We can also compute the relative risk, which is $\frac{0.6667}{0.2000} = 3.33$.

Participants in the dolphin therapy treatment group were 3.33 times as likely to improve as control subjects.

However, participants were not randomly selected, so we would be limited in our ability to generalize these results.

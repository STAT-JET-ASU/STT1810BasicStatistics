* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we explored differences in proportions for two groups ($\pi_1 - \pi_2$).

* In Chapter 6, we will apply what we learned to assess *quantitative* variables.

* We will compare means of two groups ($\mu_1 - \mu_2$).

## Learning Goals for Chapter 6

Chapter 6 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, where $\mu$ is the population *mean*. A sample mean will be designated with $\bar{x}$. We typically will have a null of $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ or $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (i.e., *no difference*). 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample means numerically and graphically. [Section 6.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population means. [Section 6.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 6.1

* Calculate or estimate the mean, median, quartiles, five number summary, and interquartile range from a dataset and understand what these are measuring.
* When comparing two quantitative distributions, identify which has the larger mean, median, standard deviation, and inter-quartile range.
* Identify whether there is likely an association between a binary categorical variable and a quantitative response variable.


## Section 6.1 New Vocabulary

* five-number summary
   * minimum
   * lower quartile
   * median
   * upper quartile
   * maximum
* interquartile range
* boxplot

We also will revisit several vocab terms from the Preliminaries and introduce a guideline for identifying data points that might be considered outliers in a quantitative *distribution*.


##

**five-number summary:** a set of five data summaries composed of minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, maximum

**minimum / maximum:** the smallest / largest data values

**lower quartile:** the value for which 25% of the data lie below (and 75% lie above); also known as the 25th percentile

**median:** the value for which 50% of the data lie below (and 50% lie above)---the middle value when the data are sorted in order from smallest to largest; also known as the 50th percentile

**upper quartile:** the value for which 75% of the data lie below (and 55% lie above); also known as the 75th percentile

**interquartile range:** IQR = upper quartile --- lower quartile

**boxplot:** a visual display of the five-number summary


## Recall: Exploring Data (Section P.2)

Quantitative data are described by how / where they occur on the number line. Distribution behavior includes:

**shape:** the overall pattern and "clumping" of the data when we graph it (e.g., using a dotplot or histogram)

**center:** a middle or typical value of a quantitative variable; the "center of mass" for the distribution (e.g., mean)

**variability:** once we have identified the center, how spread out are the data---are most within a certain range of values?

**unusual observations / features:** points that deviate markedly from the overall pattern of the other data values (i.e., outliers); also other unusual features such as multiple modes

Old Faithful (Yellowstone National Park) erupts around 20 times a day. [According to the National Park Service](https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/geysers-hot-springs/about-old-faithful/), "... eruptions are predicted with a 90 percent confidence rate, within a 10 minute variation," based on duration/height of the previous eruption.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch06/oldfaithful.jpg", dpi = 175)
```


## Example 6.1 Geyser Eruptions

**research question:** Has there been a change in Old Faithful's eruption patterns between 1978 and 2003?

**type of study:** observational study (why?)

**observational units:** individual geyser eruptions

**explanatory variable:** year (binary categorical, 1978 or 2003)

**response variable:** time until the next eruption (quantitative)

**measurement units:** the quantitative variable "time until the next eruption" is measured in minutes

**data:** eruptions that occurred from August 1 to August 8, 1978 (6:00am to midnight), also from the same time interval in 2003


## Comparing with Dotplots

We can explore these data in the [ISI Descriptive Statistics Applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/descstats/Dotplot.htm).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch06/fig_06_01_01.jpg", dpi = 150)
```

* What is the shape of each distribution?
* What is the center of each distribution?
* What is the spread (variability) of each distribution?
* Does either distribution have any unusual points/outliers?
* How do the two distributions compare to one another?


## Comparing with Statistics

| Year | Mean |  SD  | Minimum | Lower<br>Quartile | Median | Upper<br>Quartile | Maximum | Interquartile<br>Range (IQR) |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-------:|:-----------------:|:------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------------------------:|
| 1978 | 71.1 | 12.9 |    42   |         58        |   75   |         81        |    95   |              23              | 
| 2003 | 91.2 |  8.5 |    56   |         87        |   91   |         98        |   110   |              11              |

**Key Idea: Resistant Measures**

* Median is a resistant measure of center, whereas the mean is sensitive to extreme values and skewness.
* IQR is a resistant measure of variability, whereas the standard deviation is sensitive to extreme values and skewness.


## Comparing with Boxplots

The box displays the middle 50% of the distribution; its width  is the IQR. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values in the dataset *that are not outliers*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch06/fig_06_01_02.jpg", dpi = 100)
```

There appear to be two lower outliers in 2003 (the * on the plot).


## Anatomy of a Boxplot

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch06/boxplot.png", dpi = 90)
```

lower outlier = any data value < $\text{lower quartile} - 1.5 * IQR$

upper outlier = any data value > $\text{upper quartile} + 1.5 * IQR$


##

A data point may be an outlier *relative to the group it belongs to*.

**For 1978:**

$\text{lower quartile} - 1.5 * IQR = 58 - (1.5 * 23) = 23.5$ 

$\text{upper quartile} + 1.5 * IQR = 81 + (1.5 * 23) = 115.5$ 

*None of the data points in 1978 fall outside these two boundaries.*

<hr>

**For 2003:**

$\text{lower quartile} - 1.5 * IQR = 87 - (1.5 * 11) = 70.5$ 

$\text{upper quartile} + 1.5 * IQR = 98 + (1.5 * 11) = 114.5$ 

*As we see on both plots, there are two data points less than 70.5.*


## Think About It

Based on the distributions of times between eruptions, in which year would you have preferred to be a tourist waiting for the next eruption of Old Faithful? Can you think of one way in which 1978 would have been preferable and a different way in which 2003 would have been preferable?

* If you are a tourist who cares most about having a shorter wait for the next eruption, you would have preferred 1978. This is because the *average* wait time was about 20 minutes less than in 2003. 

* If your primary concern is being able to predict accurately when the next eruption would occur, then you would have preferred 2003. This is because the *variability* in wait times was much smaller than in 1978.

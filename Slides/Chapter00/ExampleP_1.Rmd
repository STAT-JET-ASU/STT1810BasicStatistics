## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section P.1 Introduction to the Six-Step Method.

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

## STEP 1: Ask a Research Question

**General Question:** Can we find a way to increase the likelihood that a person agrees to become an organ donor? 

However, this question is simply too broad to design a study for. We need to focus it more into a question about which we could reasonably collect data to produce an answer.

Consider: In the United States, everyone 18 years of age or older is eligible to register as an organ donor on their driver's license. What is the ***process*** of asking people to be donors?

**Research Question:** Does the default option that is presented to driver’s license applicants influence the probability that a person will choose to become an organ donor?

*The research question influences our study design and hypotheses.*


## STEP 2: Design a Study / Collect Data

The researchers recruited participants using online forums and offered them $4.00 to complete an online survey. If they agreed, they were asked to pretend to apply for a new driver’s license. 

Participants did not know that organ donation was the focus of the study or that different options would be given to people.

Before data analysis, the researchers removed data where there were repeat responses from the same IP address, where surveys were completed in less than five seconds, or where people had addresses that could not be verified (*... they might be bots*).

*Can you think of any potential problems with this methodology that might affect the results of the study? What are some positive aspects of this design?* [*We will learn about study design in Chapter 4.*]


## Organ Donation Options

Participants were asked to imagine they moved into a new state. When they apply for a driver’s license, they have to decide about being an organ donor. 

Each person was given one of three possible scenarios (choices).

* *Opt-in* group : The default option in the application was *not* to be a donor. Participants had to choose to become a donor.

* *Opt-out* group : The default option in the application was to be a donor. People had to choose *not* to become a donor.

* *Neutral group* : There was no default option in the application. People had to specifically choose to become an organ donor or not to become a donor.


## Additional Design Details

observational units

* 161 recruited volunteers

explanatory variable

* default donation option (categorical, three treatment groups)

response variable

* choice *to be* or *not to be* an organ donor (categorical, binary)

study design

* randomized experiment (*assuming participants were randomly assigned to the three donation options*)


## STEP 3: Explore the Data

Who agreed to become donors?

* **opt-in** group : 41.8% yes
* **opt-out** group : 82.0% yes
* **neutral group** : 78.6% yes 

The neutral and opt-out groups had higher percentages of organ donors.

:::

::::

* $\frac{82.0}{41.8}$ ≈ 2 &rarr; opt-out was about twice as likely vs. opt-in
* $\frac{78.6}{41.8}$ ≈ 1.9 &rarr; neutral was 1.9 times as likely to say yes 

[*We will explore segmented bar graphs and risk ratios in Chapter 5.*]


## STEP 4: Draw Inferences

Using methods that we will learn in this course, the researchers analyzed whether the observed differences between the groups were large enough to show that the type of default option had a genuine effect on the probability people would say yes. 

They also estimated the size of the differences that they found. 

This study reported strong evidence that the neutral and opt-out defaults produced a higher chance of a person choosing to be a donor, as compared to the opt-in version used by many states. [*We will learn about strength of evidence in Chapter 1.*]

Given the sample characteristics, they could be confident that the neutral version increases the chance a person will agree to be a donor by somewhere between 20% and 54% compared to opt-in. [*We will learn about estimation in Chapter 3.*]


## STEP 5: Formulate Conclusions

In this study, participants given the “opt-in” strategy were much less likely to agree to become organ donors. People in the opt-out group were twice as likely to agree to be donors compared to opt-in. The neutral group was close to twice as likely to agree (1.88 times) compared to the opt-in group.

The researchers conclude that "changes in defaults could [result in] additional thousands of donors a year.” 

[*We will learn more about making generalizations in Chapter 2 and cause-and-effect conclusions in Chapter 4.*]

## STEP 6: Look Back and Ahead

One study limitation is that participants were asked to *imagine* how they would respond; this might not reflect real behavior. 

A new study might look at actual responses to questions about donation or monitor rates for states that adopt a new policy. 

Researchers could examine whether giving educational material about organ donation might increase willingness to donate. 

Another possible improvement would be to include participants from wider demographic groups than these volunteers.

Part of looking back also considers how a study relates to other similar studies that have been conducted previously.

*What other factors could impact someone's choice to be a donor?*


## Looking Ahead: Variation in Data

ATS (access to transplant) score indicates the probability that a person on the U.S. transplant wait list gets a transplant from a deceased donor. Variation in scores reflects the fairness of the system. *Less* variation means *more* fairness---the probabilities are more alike for all the people on the list. We will learn about standard deviation in Section P.2. (Source: [OTPN / UNOS](https://insights.unos.org/equity-in-access/))

* **We will address strength of evidence (*significance*) in Chapter 1.**

* We will discuss breadth of results (*generalization*) in Chapter 2.

* We will learn about effect size of results (*estimation*) in Chapter 3.

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 1

* Use the chance model to determine whether an observed statistic is unlikely to occur. [Section 1.1]
* Calculate and interpret a *p*-value, and state the strength of evidence it provides against the null hypothesis. [Section 1.2]
* Calculate a standardized statistic for a single proportion and evaluate the strength of evidence it provides against a null hypothesis. [Section 1.3]
* Describe how the distance of the observed statistic from the parameter value specified by the null hypothesis, sample size, and one- vs. two-sided tests affect the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. [Section 1.4]

We will not cover Section 1.5, which introduces a theory-based method of inference for a single proportion.


## Learning Goals for Section 1.3

* Find a standardized statistic from the observed proportion of “successes” in the data, the hypothesized mean of the null distribution (i.e., *the value of the parameter that is specified in Ho*), and standard deviation (SD) of the null distribution as produced by the ISI [One Proportion](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet (i.e., simulation).
* Interpret a standardized statistic.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis Ho) based on the magnitude of the standardized statistic.
* Recognize that standardizing the statistic is an alternative measure of strength of evidence.


## Recall from Section 1.2

**test of significance (or significance test):** the formal process we usually use for any assessment of strength of evidence

(1) Make a claim about the parameter of interest ($H_0$ and $H_a$) 
(2) Gather and explore data relevant to the claim
(3) Calculate an observed statistic from the data
(4) Simulate a null distribution (assuming that $H_0$ is true)
(5) Measure the strength of evidence that the observed statistic provides against Ho (using the null distribution as a "ruler")
(6) Draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis 

*Recall that steps 3, 4, and 5 are the components of the 3S process!*


## Section 1.3 New Vocabulary

**standardize / standardized statistic:** To standardize a statistic, compute the distance of the observed statistic from the mean (hypothesized) of the null distribution, then divide by the SD of the null distribution.

$$\text{std. statistic} = \frac{\text{statistic} - \text{mean of null distribution}}{\text{SD of null distribution}}$$

Mathematically, this is similar to transforming °F to °C --- it's a new scale that doesn't change the *meaning* of the data. 

When performing this rescaling, the *units of measurement* cancel out, which is why it's *standardized* and applicable across a broad range of possible problems. // The value tells us how many SDs the observed statistic is above or below the hypothesized mean.


## Example: Recall Our [ESP Test](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/STT1810BasicStatistics/Slides/ChapterXX/ESPZenerCards.html)

We can [simulate](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) a null distribution for our Zener card ESP test, assuming the person is just guessing ($\pi = 0.20, n = 25$). 

$$H_o: \pi = 0.20$$

$$H_a: \pi > 0.20$$

The mean of the null distribution is 0.20 and the SD is 0.08 (*see next slide*). Suppose I identify 9 out of 25 cards correctly.

$$\text{standardized statistic} = z = \frac{9/25 - 0.20}{0.08} = 2.0$$

Since $z = 2.0$, my result is two standard deviations above the mean; i.e., *two times (twice) the average distance from the mean*.


## 

I used 10,000 repetitions to get a more reliable SD estimation.

| Cards Correct | Proportion Correct | Standardized Score ($z$)    |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| $0$           | $0.00$             |$(0.00 - 0.20) / 0.08 = -2.5$|
| $1$           | $0.04$             |$(0.04 - 0.20) / 0.08 = -2.0$|
| $3$           | $0.12$             |$(0.12 - 0.20) / 0.08 = -1.0$|
| $5$           | $0.20$             |$(0.20 - 0.20) / 0.08 =  0.0$|
| $7$           | $0.28$             |$(0.28 - 0.20) / 0.08 = +1.0$|
| $9$           | $0.36$             |$(0.36 - 0.20) / 0.08 = +2.0$|
| $11$          | $0.44$             |$(0.44 - 0.20) / 0.08 = +3.0$|
| $13$          | $0.52$             |$(0.52 - 0.20) / 0.08 = +4.0$|


## Quantifying Strength of Evidence

As with $p$-values, there are some guidelines for interpretation. A large standardized score generally indicates the observed value is in one of the *tails* of the null distribution rather than near the center. The direction for "extreme" depends on $H_a$.

| Magnitude                | Strength of Evidence                              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| between -1.5 and +1.5    | not much evidence against the null hypothesis     |
| below -1.5 or above +1.5 | moderate evidence against the null hypothesis     |
| below -2.0 or above +2.0 | strong evidence against the null hypothesis       |
| below -3.0 or above +3.0 | very strong evidence against  the null hypothesis |


## ESP Statistical Significance

My result of 9 (36%) cards correct, with its $z$-score of 2, would be considered *statistically significant*. In other words, it is unlikely to be the result of just random chance. With such strong evidence, I would say the chance model is *implausible*. I have ESP! 

We can see from the various calculations that 9 or more correct would lead to us rejecting $H_0$. Nine (9) correct cards out of 25 is 2 SDs above the mean. Eleven cards is 3SDs. Getting all 25 cards correct is a remarkable 10 SDs above the mean!

A phenomena called "psi-missing" refers to doing much *less* well than chance on an ESP-type test. We would use $H_a: \pi < 0.20$ in this case. What number(s) of cards correct would indicate psi-missing, if we use a $z$-score to measure strength?


## A Mound-Shaped Example

Notice that the center of the distribution is 0. Values *below* the mean have a negative $z$-score. Observations more than 2 or 3 SDs from the mean can be considered "in the tail".

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="*standardized values on a bell-shaped distribution.*"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/stdstatbellcurve.png", dpi = 120)
```

The farther from zero the standardized statistic is, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Like a *p*-value, we can directly compare standardized values across datasets. 


## Standardized Test Scores

A common place to see standardized scores is on standardized tests or IQ tests! This is an example from the [Cora Lee Institute](https://coraleeinstitute.org/understanding-standardized-test-scores/).

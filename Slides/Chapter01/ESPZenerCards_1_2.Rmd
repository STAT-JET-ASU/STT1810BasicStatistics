## Recall Our [ESP Test and Exploration](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/STT1810BasicStatistics/Slides/Chapter00/ESPZenerCards_P_1.html)

In our Zener card ESP test, the parameter of interest is the long-run probability that the person who is being tested can correctly identify the symbol on a card. Logically, given the testing set-up, we would expect someone who is purely guessing to get 20% of presented cards correct.

<hr>

Let $\pi$ be the long-term probability of correctly identifying a card. In this context, our two options are:

* the person is just randomly guessing, and therefore $\pi$ = 0.20
* the person is not guessing and $\pi$ > 0.20 (*better than* guessing)

These options form our null and alternative hypotheses, which we typically express in symbolic statistical language.


##

Our hypotheses are formed from our parameter definition ($\pi$) and our two stated options.

$H_0:$ The long-term probability of correctly identifying a card is equal to $0.20$.

$H_0:$ The long-term probability of correctly identifying a card is greater than $0.20$.

We can concisely rewrite our hypotheses in statistical symbols.

$H_0: \pi = 0.20$

$H_a: \pi > 0.20$

<hr>

Now that we have established our parameter and hypotheses in this context, we can consider the data we collected. 


## The 3S Process

**Statistic:** Suppose I got 9 of 25 cards correct on my ESP test. We will use the proportion of successes as our statistic: $\hat{p} = 0.36$.

**Simulate:** We can simulate a null distribution for our Zener card ESP test using our [One Proportion](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet, assuming the person being tested is just guessing. We will set $\pi = 0.20$ and $n = 25$, with 1000 or more samples (repetitions). 

To calculate the *p*-value after simulating the null distribution, we count how many simulated samples are $\ge \hat{p} = 0.36$, since that is the direction indicated in our alternative hypothesis.

Once we get the count, we divide by the number of simulations to get a proportion of values $\ge \hat{p} = 0.36$.

**Strength of Evidence:** From my simulation, I obtained a *p*-value of **0.0490**. My actual statistic is located fairly far out in the upper tail of the null distribution, as shown on the simulation plot.

Consulting our guidelines, my *p*-value is between 0.01 and 0.05. This means I have **strong evidence** against the null hypothesis.

| Magnitude               | Guideline for Inference                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| *p*-value > 0.10        | not much evidence against $H_0$                             |
| 0.05 < *p*-value ≤ 0.10 | moderate evidence against $H_0$                             |
| 0.01 < *p*-value ≤ 0.05 | strong evidence against $H_0$ **&larr; 0.0490 falls here!** |
| *p*-value ≤ 0.01        | very strong evidence against $H_0$                          |


## What Does It Mean To Reject $H_0$?

According to our guidelines, I have strong evidence against the null hypothesis. My results are **statistically significant**; unlikely to be due to random chance. Therefore, I will reject $H_0$.

When we reject a null hypothesis, we will accept the alternative (*research*) hypothesis. Here, that is : "The long-run probability of correctly identifying a card is greater than $0.20$."

Notice that the research hypothesis does not state exactly how strong my ESP ability is, just that my probability of identifying a card is better than guessing (20%)---logically, we can say it must be somewhere between 20% and 100%.

In Chapter 3, we will learn about how to estimate the value of a parameter, to narrow down the set of possible values. 


## Generalization

*Okay, but maybe I don't have ESP...?*

From a probability point of view, we *did* reject the plausibility of the chance model, but the breath of our conclusions are limited by the nature of the experiment and our sample.

It's still *possible* that the results were due to random chance and we drew an incorrect decision based on the data.

If our data and testing process lead us to declare our results to be statistically significant and we reject $H_0$ (the chance model), but the person really is just guessing, that is called a *Type I Error*. We will discuss this more in Section 1.4.

**Look back and ahead:** how can we improve our data collection?

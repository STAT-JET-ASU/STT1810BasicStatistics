## Recall Our [ESP Test and Exploration](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/STT1810BasicStatistics/Slides/Chapter00/ESPZenerCards_P_1.html)

In our Zener card example for Section 1.2, we discussed defining the parameter and formulating hypotheses.

<hr>

Let $\pi$ be the long-term probability of correctly identifying a card.

$$H_0: \pi = 0.20 \text{ (guessing)}$$ 

$$H_a: \pi > 0.20 \text{ (has ESP)}$$

Suppose I correctly identified 9 cards. My sample proportion is therefore $\hat{p} = 9/25 = 0.36$.

<hr>

What *strength of evidence* is provided by these ESP test results? We addressed this using the *p*-value approach in Section 1.2.


## Simulate and Compute *p*-Value

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/OneProportionAppletZenerB.png", dpi = 140)
```


## Strength of Evidence / Conclusions

The estimated *p*-value from my simulation is 0.0490. The results are statistically significant --- that is, unlikely to be due to chance alone. The chance model is thus *implausible* in this situation. We will conclude $H_a$ instead. I have ESP!

| Magnitude               | Guideline for Inference                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| *p*-value > 0.10        | not much evidence against $H_0$                             |
| 0.05 < *p*-value ≤ 0.10 | moderate evidence against $H_0$                             |
| 0.01 < *p*-value ≤ 0.05 | strong evidence against $H_0$ **&larr; 0.0490 falls here!** |
| *p*-value ≤ 0.01        | very strong evidence against $H_0$                          |


## Alternative Measure of Strength

***Definition***
<hr>
**standardize / standardized statistic:** To standardize a statistic, compute the distance of the observed statistic from the mean, then divide by the SD of the null distribution.

$$\text{std. statistic} = \frac{\text{statistic} - \text{mean of null distribution}}{\text{SD of null distribution}}$$

<hr>

We will obtain the standard deviation we need by simulating the null distribution. The settings are the same as they were for our test in Section 1.2, since the scenario is the same.  

Set $\pi = 0.20$ and $n = 25$, with 1000+ samples (or repetitions).


##

I used 10,000 repetitions to get a more reliable SD estimation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/OneProportionAppletZener.png", dpi = 150)
```


## Compute the *z*-Score

Plug the mean (0.200) and SD (0.080) values from the Summary Statistics into their correct places in the formula, along with the statistic we computed from the data, $\hat{p} = 0.36$.

<hr>

$$z\text{-score} = \frac{\text{statistic} - \text{mean of null distribution}}{\text{SD of null distribution}}$$
<br>

$$z\text{-score} = \frac{0.36 - 0.200}{0.080} = 2.00$$
<hr>

Since $z = 2.00$, my test result is two standard deviations above the mean (i.e., *it is twice the average distance from the mean*).


## Quantifying Strength of Evidence

As with $p$-values, there are guidelines for interpretation. A large standardized score indicates the observed value is in one of the distribution *tails*. The upper tail has large positive values.

My *z*-score is exactly +2 --- we have **strong evidence** against $H_0$.

| Magnitude                | Strength of Evidence                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| between -1.5 and +1.5    | not much evidence against $H_0$                         |
| below -1.5 or above +1.5 | moderate evidence against $H_0$                         |
| below -2.0 or above +2.0 | strong evidence against $H_0$ **&larr; +2 falls here!** |
| below -3.0 or above +3.0 | very strong evidence against $H_0$                      |


## 

Other $\hat{p}$ values. Notice *z* values below, above, and at the mean*.

| Cards Correct | Proportion Correct | Standardized Score ($z$)           |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| $1$           | $0.04$             |$(0.04 - 0.200) / 0.080 = -2.00$    |
| $3$           | $0.12$             |$(0.12 - 0.200) / 0.080 = -1.00$    |
| * $5$ *       | * $0.20$ *         |* $(0.20 - 0.200) / 0.080 =  0.00$ *|
| $7$           | $0.28$             |$(0.28 - 0.200) / 0.080 = +1.00$    |
| $9$           | $0.36$             |$(0.36 - 0.200) / 0.080 = +2.00$    |
| $11$          | $0.44$             |$(0.44 - 0.200) / 0.080 = +3.00$    |
| $13$          | $0.52$             |$(0.52 - 0.200) / 0.080 = +4.00$    |


## Statistical Significance

My result of 9 (36%) cards correct, with its *z*-score of 2, would be considered *statistically significant*. In other words, it is unlikely to be the result of just random chance. With such strong evidence, we would say the chance model is *implausible* and reject $H_0$. So, we accept $H_a$. This finding agrees with my *p*-value results. 

We can see from the various calculations that 9 or more correct would lead to us rejecting $H_0$. Nine (9) correct cards out of 25 is 2 SDs above the mean. Eleven cards is 3SDs. Getting all 25 cards correct is a remarkable TEN (10) SDs above the mean!

A phenomena called "psi-missing" refers to doing much *less* well than chance on an ESP-type test. We would use $H_a: \pi < 0.20$ in this case. What number(s) of cards correct would indicate psi-missing, if we use a $z$-score to measure strength?

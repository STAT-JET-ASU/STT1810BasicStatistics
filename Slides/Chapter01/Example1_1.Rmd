## Before We Beginâ€¦

These slides are meant to accompany [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 1.1 Intro to Chance Models. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

## STEP 1: Ask a Research Question

**General Question:** Can dolphins communicate with one another in an abstract manner?

**Research Question:** TBA?

[*The research question influences our study design and hypotheses.*]


## STEP 2: Design a Study / Collect Data

TBA

*Can you think of any potential problems with this methodology that might affect the results of the study? What are some positive aspects of this design?*


## Additional Design Details

observational units

* each of Buzz's attempts (sometimes called *trials*)

explanatory variable

* whether the light was blinking or steady (two treatments)

response variable

* whether or not Buzz pushed the correct button on each trial (categorical, binary)

study design

* randomized experiment (*assuming the two light options were randomized across the trials*)


## STEP 3: Explore the Data

TBA


## STEP 4: Draw Inferences

TBA


## STEP 5: Formulate Conclusions

TBA


## STEP 6: Look Back and Ahead

TBA

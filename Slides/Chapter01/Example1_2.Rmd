## Before We Beginâ€¦

These slides were created to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 1.1 Introduction to Chance Models. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

See [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) for additional readings, videos, and assignments.

You can print these slides to a pdf for offline use using the print function in your browser.


## Learning Goals for Section 1.2

* Use appropriate symbols for parameter and statistic.
* State the null and the alternative hypotheses in words and in terms of the symbol $\pi$, the long-run proportion.
* Explain how to conduct a simulation using a null hypothesis probability that is not 50-50.
* Use the ISI [One Proportion](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet to obtain the *p*-value after carrying out an appropriate simulation.
* Anticipate the null distribution's center and how it changes based on using proportion or count as the statistic.
* Interpret the *p*-value and explain why a smaller *p*-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis and null hypothesis based on the *p*-value.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

## Before We Begin…

These slides were created to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 1.1 Introduction to Chance Models. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

See [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) for additional readings, videos, and assignments.

You can print these slides to a pdf for offline use using the print function in your browser.


## Learning Goals for Section 1.3

* Find a standardized statistic from the observed proportion of “successes” in the data, the hypothesized mean of the null distribution, and the standard deviation (SD) of the null distribution as produced by the ISI [One Proportion](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet.
* Interpret a standardized statistic.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis Ho) based on the magnitude of the standardized statistic.
* Recognize that standardizing the statistic is an alternative measure of strength of evidence.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

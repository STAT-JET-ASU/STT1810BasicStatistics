## Before We Begin…

These slides were created to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 1.1 Introduction to Chance Models. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

See [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) for additional readings, videos, and assignments.

You can print these slides to a pdf for offline use using the print function in your browser.


## Learning Goals for Section 1.4

* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is smaller when the observed proportion of successes is farther away from the hypothesized value of the long-run proportion of successes.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is smaller when the sample size is larger.
* Recognize when a two-sided test / alternative hypothesis is suggested by the research question.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the *p*-value is larger when the alternative hypothesis is two-sided.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

* We addressed strength of evidence (*significance*) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We addressed the breadth of results (*generalization*) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* **We will discuss effect size of results (*estimation*) in Chapter 3.**

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on ***estimation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Often, we use estimation to indicate how large an effect is, not as a single number, but as an ***interval*** of statistically likely or plausible values.

<hr>

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique. [Section 3.1]
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method. [Section 3.2]
* Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval. [Section 3.4]

We will not cover Section 3.3, theoretical estimation for a mean.


## Learning Goals for Section 3.2

In Section 3.1 you learned about estimation using intervals of plausible values. In Section 3.2, you will explore how to create confidence intervals using standardization --- in particular, the “two standard deviation method” (or the "2SD method") for an approximate 95% confidence interval.

<hr>

* Compute a confidence interval for a proportion written in terms of its endpoints vs. a confidence interval written in terms of center plus or minus a margin of error.
* Approximate a 95% confidence interval for a proportion by using the 2SD method.

*Note: We will not be doing the theory-based confidence intervals introduced in this section. Focus on the 2SD method.*


## Section 3.2 New Vocabulary

Recall that you learned about $SD(\hat{p})$, the standard deviation of $\hat{p}$, and the Central Limit Theorem in Section 2.1 

**2SD method:** we can approximate a 95% confidence interval (*if the sampling distribution of a statistic is approximately normal*) by taking the statistic and the SD of the statistic and extending the interval 2 SDs in each direction from the statistic...

$$\text{for example: } \hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

**margin of error:** the half-width of a confidence interval (for the 2SD method, this is the ± 2SD value)

**standard error / SE:** an estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic that is based on observed data


## Empirical Rule: Why the 2SD Works

For a bell-shaped (normal) curve, about 95% of the distribution will be within ±2SD of the mean---the basis of the 2SD method.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/empiricalrule.png", dpi = 110)
```

We could also create 68% and 99.7% CIs using ±1SD and ±3SD.


## The 2 Standard Deviation (SD) Method

Calculate the observed sample proportion $\hat{p}$.

Simulate the sampling distribution of  $\hat{p}$ using the same sample size $n$ as the observed sample and $\pi = 0.5$.

Calculate the standard deviation of the simulated distribution to get an estimate for the value of $SD(\hat{p})$.

Plug the values into the equation below to get a 95% confidence interval for $\pi$, based on the sample data.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

<hr>

Recall that we use $\pi = 0.5$ because $SD(\hat{p})$ is the biggest then.

## Example: Where is the Largest SD?

| $n$   |  $\pi$ |  $SD(\hat{p})$  |
|:-----:|:------:|:---------------:|
|  100  |  0.10  |     0.0300      |
|  100  |  0.25  |     0.0433      |
|  100  |  0.40  |     0.0490      |
|  100  |  0.50  |   **0.0500**    |
|  100  |  0.60  |     0.0490      |
|  100  |  0.75  |     0.0433      |
|  100  |  0.90  |     0.0300      |


## Flashback: Harley the Wonder Doggo

Use the sample proportion 0.90 and the simulated SD = 0.158 (refer to Exploration 1.1 if needed) in the calculation.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}) = 0.90 \pm 2 \times 0.158 = 0.90 \pm 0.316$$

We are 95% confident that Harley's true chance of choosing the correct cup is is between $0.90 \pm 0.316$. The margin of error on the estimate is $0.316$ or $31.6\%$.

We can also write the CI as (0.584, 1.216). We know $\pi$ cannot be &geq; 1 (*certainty*), so the interval is effectively (0.584, 0.999)

Note that all plausible values included in the interval are greater than 50%. Based on this, we can be confident in this context that the true proportion is greater than random chance.


## Flashback: Bottled vs. Tap Water

The sample proportion of people who preferred tap water was $\hat{p} = 0.1111$. Use the sample size $n = 27$ and $\pi = 0.5$ to find the simulated SD, which should be about $0.096$.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}) = 0.111 \pm 2 \times 0.096 = 0.111 \pm 0.192$$

We are 95% confident that the long-run probability a person would prefer tap water to bottled water when presented with the kind of choice offered in the experiment with four cups is between -0.081 and 0.303, or roughly about 1% to 30%.

Note that $\pi = 0.25$ is among the plausible values included in the interval. This is consistent with our failure to find statistical significance in Exploration 1.2. *Random choice is plausible.*


## Flashback: Bob or Tim?

Combining two classes of previous STT 1810 students, 31 of 38 students $(\hat{p} = 0.816)$ assigned the name Tim to the left face. Using simulation, our estimated $SD = 0.081$.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}) = 0.816 \pm 2 \times 0.081 = 0.816 \pm 0.162$$

We are $95\%$ confident that the long-run proportion of students who would assign the name Tim to the left face when given the same choice we used is between $65.4\%$ and $97.8\%$.

All plausible values in the interval are greater than $50\%$. We can be confident that the true proportion $\pi$ is greater than random chance in this context, based on our experiment.

* We addressed strength of evidence (*significance*) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We addressed the breadth of results (*generalization*) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* **We will discuss the effect size of results (*estimation*) in Chapter 3.**

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on ***estimation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Often, we use estimation to indicate how large an effect is, not as a single number, but as an ***interval*** of statistically likely or plausible values.

<hr>

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique. [Section 3.1]
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method. [Section 3.2]
* Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval. [Section 3.4]

We will not cover Section 3.3, theoretical estimation for a mean.


## Learning Goals for Section 3.2

In Section 3.1 you learned about estimation using intervals of plausible values. In Section 3.2, you will explore how to create confidence intervals using standardization --- in particular, the “two standard deviation method” (or the "2SD method") for an approximate 95% confidence interval.

<hr>

* Compute a confidence interval for a proportion written in terms of its endpoints vs. a confidence interval written in terms of center plus or minus a margin of error.
* Approximate a 95% confidence interval (CI) for a proportion by using the 2SD method.

*Note: We will not be doing the theory-based confidence intervals introduced in this section. Focus on the 2SD method.*


## Section 3.2 New Vocabulary

Recall, you learned about $SD(\hat{p})$---the standard deviation of a $\hat{p}$ statistic---and the Central Limit Theorem in Section 2.1 

**<mark>2SD method</mark> :** we can approximate a 95% confidence interval (*if the sampling distribution of a statistic is approximately normal*) by taking the statistic and the SD of the statistic and extending the interval 2 SDs in each direction from the statistic...

$$\text{for example: } \hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

**<mark>margin of error</mark> :** the half-width of a confidence interval; for the 2SD method, this is the ± 2SD component

**<mark>standard error / SE</mark> :** an estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic that is based on observed data


## Empirical Rule: Why the 2SD Works

For a bell-shaped (Normal) curve, about 95% of the distribution will be within ±2SD of the mean---the basis of the 2SD method.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/empiricalrule.png", dpi = 110)
```

We could also create 68% and 99.7% CIs using ±1SD and ±3SD.


## The Two Standard Deviation Method

Calculate the observed sample proportion $\hat{p}$.

Simulate the sampling distribution of  $\hat{p}$ using the same sample size $n$ as the observed sample and $\pi = 0.5$.

Calculate the standard deviation of the simulated distribution to get an estimate for the value of $SD(\hat{p})$.

Plug the values into the equation below to get a 95% confidence interval for $\pi$, based on the sample data.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

<hr>

Recall that we use $\pi = 0.5$ because $SD(\hat{p})$ is the biggest then.

## Where is the Largest SD? At $\pi = 0.50!$

|  $n$  |        $\pi$        |      $SD(\hat{p})$    |

|  100  |        0.60         |        0.0490         |
|  100  |        0.75         |        0.0433         |
|  100  |        0.90         |        0.0300         |


## Example 3.2 Cyberbullying

In a March 7–April 10, 2018 survey of a random sample of 743 U.S. teenagers (ages 13 to 17 years), the Pew Research Center found that 59% said they had experienced cyberbullying. Use the [ISI One-Proportion](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet to estimate the SD.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/2SD95CI.PNG", dpi = 100)
```


## Calculating the Interval

Use the sample $\hat{p} = 0.59$ and the simulated $SD(\hat{p}) = 0.018$.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}) = 0.59 \pm 2 \times 0.018 = 0.59 \pm 0.036$$

We are 95% confident that the true proportion of U.S. teens who had experienced cyberbullying (defined by the Pew survey) was between $0.59 \pm 0.036$. The margin of error on this estimate is the $\pm 0.036$ or $3.6\%$.

We can also express the confidence interval as $(0.554, 0.626)$, or as percentages, such as $55.4\%$ to $62.6\%$ of kids.

Note that all the plausible values are greater than $50\%$. Based on this, we can be (*sadly*) confident that a majority of U.S. teens 13-17 years old had experienced cyberbullying in 2018.

## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 3.4 Factors That Affect the Width of a Confidence Interval. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

* We addressed strength of evidence (*significance*) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We addressed the breadth of results (*generalization*) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* **We will discuss the effect size of results (*estimation*) in Chapter 3.**

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on ***estimation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Often, we use estimation to indicate how large an effect is, not as a single number, but as an ***interval*** of statistically likely or plausible values.

<hr>

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique. [Section 3.1]
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method. [Section 3.2]
* Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval. [Section 3.4]

We will not cover Section 3.3, theoretical estimation for a mean.


## Learning Goals for Section 3.4

In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 you explored some different confidence intervals strategies. Despite using different methods, the results was interpreted the same way. Section 3.4 explores how sample characteristics can influence confidence interval ***width***. 

<hr>

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the confidence level increases, the width of the confidence interval increases.

    **in short: increased ↑ confidence = increased ↑ width**

* Apply the idea that the confidence level of an interval corresponds to its coverage probability (*the proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter value across many, many random samples*) in the interpretation of confidence intervals.


##

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as sample size increases, the resulting confidence interval width decreases.

    *In short*: **increased ↑ sample size = decreased ↓ width **

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample proportion gets farther from 0.5, standard error decreases and thus a resulting confidence interval will be narrower.

    *In short*: **probability being farther from 0.05 (0 ← 0.5 → 1) in either direction = ↓ sampling variability = ↓ width **

* Recognize that statistical significance on its own does not imply evidence of a large difference from Ho. This issue is especially relevant with large sample sizes. 
* Know that *p*-values address statistical significance while CIs help assess the plausible size of the parameter.


## Section 3.4 New Vocabulary

There is no new vocabulary in this section. 

Review vocabulary from previous sections to solidify concepts. Notice that this section addresses many of the same ideas you saw in Section 1.4 What Impacts Strength of Evidence?

Confidence intervals and significance testing are two aspects of the same general inferential process. Take some time to review and recognize what they have in common.

<hr>

A note about Section 3.4 ...

Much of the specific discussion in Section 3.4 is framed around theoretical confidence intervals, which we did not cover. But, in general, the ideas apply to all confidence intervals.

## Example 3.4 American Cat Ownership

In a 2016 poll by the American Veterinary Medical Association, $25.43\%$ of $41,000$ respondents said they own at least one cat.

<hr>

$\hat{p} = 0.2543$

$n = 41,000$

*larger % confidence = wider confidence interval (CI)*

| 90% confidence   | 95% confidence       | 99% confidence       |  
|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| (0.2508, 0.2578) | **(0.2501, 0.2585)** | **(0.2488, 0.2598)** |
| width = 0.0070   | **width = 0.0084**   | **width = 0.0110**   |


##

$\hat{p} = 0.2543$ &rarr; *larger sample size = narrower confidence interval*

| $n = 500$, 95% CI | $n = 1000$, 95% CI   | $n = 2000$, 95% CI   |  
|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| (0.2158, 0.2922)  | **(0.2270, 0.2810)** | **(0.2349, 0.2731)** |
| width = 0.0764    | **width = 0.0540**   | **width = 0.0382**   |

<br>
<hr>

$n = 41,000$ &rarr; $\hat{p}$ *closer to 0.5 = wider confidence interval*

| $\hat{p} = 0.2543$, 95% CI | $\hat{p} = 0.3840$, 95% CI |  
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| (0.2508, 0.2578)           | **(0.3793, 0.3887)**       |
| width = 0.0070             | **width = 0.0094**         |


## Very Large Sample Sizes

In the cat ownership example, we can see how the widths of the intervals change as we vary level of confidence, sample size, and the value of $\hat{p}$. 

**<mark>Precision</mark>** refers to the overall *width* of the confidence interval. It is a separate idea from level of confidence. 

But, we also see that a very large sample size like $n = 41,000$ makes all of the intervals using that sample size quite precise. In other words, the set of *plausible values* is quite small in all cases, even for a high level of confidence or $\hat{p} = 0.5$.

**Remember:** While level of confidence does impact the width of a confidence interval, how wide it is and the probability that the interval captures the true value are separate ideas.

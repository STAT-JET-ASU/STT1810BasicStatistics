## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 3.4 Factors That Affect the Width of a Confidence Interval. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

* We addressed strength of evidence (significance) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We will discuss breadth of results (generalization) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* **We will learn about *size* for an effect (estimation) in Chapter 3.**

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of causation, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on ***estimation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Often, we use estimation to indicate how large an effect is, not as a single number, but as an ***interval*** of statistically likely or plausible values.

<hr>

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique. [Section 3.1]
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method. [Section 3.2]
* Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval. [Section 3.4]

We will not cover Section 3.3, theoretical estimation for a mean.


## Learning Goals for Section 3.4

In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, you explored two methods for creating confidence intervals. Despite some differences, we interpreted the resulting intervals the same way. Section 3.4 explores how sample characteristics can influence confidence interval ***width***. 

<hr>

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the confidence level increases, the width of the confidence interval increases.

<p style = "text-align: center;">**increased ↑ confidence = increased ↑ width**</p>

* When in interpreting confidence intervals, apply the idea that the confidence level of an interval corresponds to its coverage probability 

**A confidence level like 95% reflects the long-run proportion of confidence intervals that contain the true parameter value.**


##

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as sample size increases, the resulting confidence interval width decreases.

<p style = "text-align: center;">**increased ↑ sample size = decreased ↓ width **</p>

**A larger sample sizes leads to a smaller standard error for the sampling distribution, thus a smaller margin of error.**

<hr>

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample proportion gets farther from 0.5, standard error decreases and thus a resulting confidence interval will be narrower.

<p style = "text-align: center;">**the proportion $\hat{p}$ being farther from 0.50 =<br>the proportion $\hat{p}$ is closer to 0 or closer to 1 =<br>decreased ↓ sampling variability = decreased ↓ width **</p>

**As we learned in earlier sections, the largest standard error for any given sample size occurs when the proportion is 0.50.**


##

* Recognize that statistical significance on its own does not imply evidence of a large difference from Ho. This issue is especially relevant with large sample sizes. 

**This difference is sometimes known as *statistical significance* versus *practical significance*. The latter implies that what we find is big enough to be useful.**

* Know that *p*-values address statistical significance while CIs help assess the plausible size of the parameter.

**But ... significance level and confidence level *are* connected.**

<hr>

If we change more than one factor at the same time, then these may combine effects to make the interval wider or narrower, or they may have opposite effects (e.g., taking a larger sample, but also using a larger level of confidence).

## Section 3.4 New Vocabulary

There is no new vocabulary in this section. 

Review vocabulary from previous sections to solidify concepts. Notice that this section addresses many of the same ideas you saw in Section 1.4 What Impacts Strength of Evidence?

Confidence intervals and significance testing are two aspects of the same general inferential process. Take some time to review and recognize what they have in common.

<hr>

A note about Section 3.4 ...

Much of the specific discussion in Section 3.4 is framed around theoretical confidence intervals, which we did not cover. But, in general, the ideas apply to all confidence intervals.

## Before We Beginâ€¦

These slides are meant to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 3.1 Statistical Inference: Confidence Intervals. 

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

## Overview of the Study

Researchers tested a dog named Marine to see whether or not she could detect colorectal cancer via smell. She sniffed breath in 5 bags from 5 different patients, only 1 of which had cancer. This process was repeated many times. Marine chose correctly in 30 out of 33 trials (sets of bags), so $\hat{p} = 0.909$. 

$H_0: \pi = 0.20$ (Marine is just guessing, 1 in 5 chance)<br>
$H_a: \pi > 0.20$ (Marine is doing better than guessing)

##

We would reject $H_0$ at the 0.05 level of significance. But, what is Marine's true probability $\pi$ of detecting cancer? We can estimate the value by testing many potential values of $\pi$ on either side of our observed sample proportion $\hat{p} = 0.909$.

|Value of $\pi$ tested in Ho|0.760 |0.761 |0.762 |...   |0.973 |0.974 |0.975 |
|--------------------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Two-sided *p*-value |0.043 |0.063 |0.063 |...   |0.059 |0.054 |0.049 |
|Reject Ho?          |Yes   |No    |No    |...   |No    |No    |Yes   |
|Plausible $\pi$?    |NO    |Yes   |Yes   |...   |Yes   |Yes   |NO    |

We are 95% confident that Marine's true probability of detecting cancer ($\pi$) is between $0.761$ and $0.974$. Much better than $20\%$!

This is more informative than simply concluding $\pi > 0.20$ ($H_a$).


## How Many Tests?

In this context, finding a 95% confidence interval with 3 decimal places, using the method of plausible values, would require over 200 tests --- every potential value of $\pi$ between 0.760 and 0.975 (i.e., 0.760, 0.761, 0.762, etc.)

A 99% confidence interval determined by this method would be wider and require even more tests! More confidence means the interval will contain more plausible values.

So why did we do this? The point is to connect our significance testing to confidence intervals, and level of significance to level of confidence. The two methods are inherently connected. 

Since we used the standard *p*-value $\leq 0.05$ rule to reject $H_0$ in all of our tests, the level of confidence is $100\% - 5\% = 95\%$.

## Before We Begin…

These slides are intended to accompany Section 3.2 2SD <strike>and Theory-Based</strike> Confidence Intervals for a Single Proportion in [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html). 

*This content does not replace reading the textbook section.* It is for class presentation and/or reference.

* We addressed *strength* of evidence (**significance**) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We will discuss *breadth* of results (**generalization**) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* &#187; We will learn about *size* for an effect (**estimation**) in Chapter 3. &#171;

* Chapter 4 will introduce the idea of **causation**, the last of the four pillars.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on ***estimation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. Often, we use estimation to indicate how large an effect is, not as a single number, but as an ***interval*** of statistically likely or plausible values.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique. [Section 3.1]
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method. [Section 3.2]
* Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval. [Section 3.4]


## Learning Goals for Section 3.2

In Section 3.1 you learned about estimation using intervals of plausible values. In Section 3.2, you will explore how to create confidence intervals using standardization --- in particular, the “two standard deviation method” (or the "2SD method") for an approximate 95% confidence interval.

<hr>

* Compute a confidence interval for a proportion written in terms of its endpoints vs. a confidence interval written in terms of center plus or minus a margin of error.
* Approximate a 95% confidence interval for a proportion by using the 2SD method.

*Note: We will not be doing the theory-based confidence intervals introduced in this section. Focus on the 2SD method.*


## Section 3.2 New Vocabulary

Recall that you learned about $SD(\hat{p})$---standard deviation of $\hat{p}$---and the Central Limit Theorem in Section 2.1 

**2SD method:** we can approximate a 95% confidence interval (*if the sampling distribution of a statistic is approximately normal*) by taking the statistic and the SD of the statistic and extending the interval 2 SDs in each direction from the statistic...

$$\text{for example: } \hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

**margin of error:** the half-width of a confidence interval (for the 2SD method, this is the ± 2SD value)

**standard error / SE:** an estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic that is based on observed data


## Empirical Rule: Why the 2SD Works

For a bell-shaped (normal) curve, about 95% of the distribution will be within ±2SD of the mean---the basis of the 2SD method.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/empiricalrule.png", dpi = 110)
```

We could also create 68% and 99.7% CIs using ±1SD and ±3SD.


## The 2 Standard Deviation (SD) Method

Calculate the observed sample proportion $\hat{p}$.

Simulate the sampling distribution of  $\hat{p}$ using the same sample size $n$ as the observed sample and $\pi = 0.5$.

Calculate the standard deviation of the simulated distribution to get an estimate for the value of $SD(\hat{p})$.

Plug the values into the equation below to get a 95% confidence interval for $\pi$, based on the sample data.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

<hr>

Recall that we use $\pi = 0.5$ because $SD(\hat{p})$ is the biggest then.

## Example: Where is the Largest SD?

| $n$   |  $\pi$ |  $SD(\hat{p})$  |
|:-----:|:------:|:---------------:|
|  100  |  0.10  |     0.0300      |
|  100  |  0.25  |     0.0433      |
|  100  |  0.40  |     0.0490      |
|  100  |  0.50  |     0.0500      |
|  100  |  0.60  |     0.0490      |
|  100  |  0.75  |     0.0433      |
|  100  |  0.90  |     0.0300      |


## Example 3.2 Cyberbullying

In a March 7–April 10, 2018 survey of a random sample of 743 U.S. teenagers (ages 13 to 17 years), the Pew Research Center found that 59% said they had experienced cyberbullying. Use the [ISI One-Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to estimate the SD.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2SD95CI.PNG", dpi = 100)
```


## Calculating the Interval

Use the sample proportion 0.59 and the simulated SD = 0.018.

$$\hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}) = 0.59 \pm 2 \times 0.018 = 0.59 \pm 0.036$$

We are 95% confident that the true proportion of U.S. teens who have experienced cyberbullying (as defined by the Pew survey) is between $0.59 \pm 0.036$. The margin of error on the estimate is $0.036$ or $3.6\%$.

We can also express the confidence interval as (0.554, 0.626) or as percentages (55.4%, 62.6%).

Note that all of the plausible values are greater than 50%. Based on this, we can be (*sadly*) confident that the true proportion $\pi$ is a majority of teens 13-17 years old.

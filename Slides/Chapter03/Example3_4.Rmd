## Pet Ownership Survey

Cats are the second-most most popular pet in the United States, after dogs. In a 2016 poll conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association, $25.43\%$ of $41,000$ respondents said they owned at least one cat. This result did not come from a random sample, but the researchers believe it is representative of adult Americans, since the demographics of the survey respondents closely match that of the population.

<hr>

We want to estimate the population proportion of cat ownership among U.S. adults using the sample data. We will consider more than one level of confidence.

$\hat{p} = 0.2543$

$n = 41,000$


## Different Levels of Confidence

The width of the confidence interval is the distance between the boundaries: (upper boundary -- lower lower boundary).

| 90% confidence   | 95% confidence       | 99% confidence       |  
|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| (0.2508, 0.2578) | **(0.2501, 0.2585)** | **(0.2488, 0.2598)** |
| width = 0.0070   | **width = 0.0084**   | **width = 0.0110**   |


<br>*As we can see, larger % confidence = wider confidence interval (CI)*

<hr>

**Note :** The confidence intervals in this example were calculated using a theory-based method that is related to our 2SD method; the ideas apply to any confidence interval.


## Different Sample Sizes

Suppose that, instead of the large sample of $41,000$ people, the statistic $\hat{p} = 0.2543$ had come from different-sized samples. In this case, the sample proportion and level of confidence are the same for all three intervals.

| $n = 500$, 95% CI | $n = 1000$, 95% CI   | $n = 2000$, 95% CI   |  
|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| (0.2158, 0.2922)  | **(0.2270, 0.2810)** | **(0.2349, 0.2731)** |
| width = 0.0764    | **width = 0.0540**   | **width = 0.0382**   |

<br>*As we can see, larger sample size = narrower confidence interval (CI)*


## Different Sample Proportions

For the sample of $n = 41,000$, suppose the proportion was a different value than $\hat{p} = 0.2543$. In this case, compare it to the $38.4\%$ of respondents who reported owning a dog. In this case, the sample size and level of confidence are the same for both intervals.

| $\hat{p} = 0.2543$, 95% CI | $\hat{p} = 0.3840$, 95% CI |  
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| (0.2508, 0.2578)           | **(0.3793, 0.3887)**       |
| width = 0.0070             | **width = 0.0094**         |

<br>*As we can see, value closer to 0.50 = wider confidence interval (CI)*


## Very Large Sample Sizes

In the cat ownership example, we can see how the widths of the intervals change as we vary level of confidence, sample size, and the value of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$. 

**<mark>Precision</mark>** refers to the overall *width* of the confidence interval. It is a separate idea from level of confidence. 

But, we also see that a very large sample size like $n = 41,000$ makes all of the intervals using that sample size very precise. In other words, the set of *plausible values* is quite small in all cases, even for a high level of confidence or $\hat{p} = 0.5$.

**Remember:** While level of confidence does impact the width of a confidence interval, how wide it is and the probability that the interval captures the true value are separate ideas.

## Strong Evidence = Large Difference?

***Key Idea about Very Large Sample Sizes***

<hr>

Especially with large sample sizes, even a fairly small difference between an observed proportion and hypothesized proportion can be statistically significant. 

In such cases, making a confidence interval for the population parameter can help us to decide whether or not the difference is large (and how meaningful it might be in real life).

This is true for other summary values as well, such as means of quantitative variables.

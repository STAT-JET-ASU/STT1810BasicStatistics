## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 4.2 Observational Studies vs. Experiments.

*This content does not replace reading the textbook section.* It is for class presentation and/or reference in STT 1810 Basic Statistics.

* We addressed strength of evidence (*significance*) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We addressed the breadth of results (*generalization*) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Good job!***

* We addressed the size of an effect (**estimation**) in Chapter 3. ✔ ***Good job!***

* **Chapter 4 introduces the idea of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.**

## Learning Goals for Chapter 4

Chapter 4 focuses on ***causation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. 

Overall, the main goal is to explain when and why we can infer cause-and-effect after we determine via a significance test that there is an ***association*** between two variables. 

<hr>

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies. [Section 4.1]

* Explain how studies using random assignment are able to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. [Section 4.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 4.2

* Identify a study as observational or experimental.
* Explain that random assignment gives us the ability to draw cause–effect conclusions because it ensures that treatment groups have similar characteristics.
* Identify whether a study uses random assignment and/or random sampling and the implications of these design decisions on the conclusions that can be drawn.
* Describe what a block study design is and the benefits of using a blocking variable.


## Review Section 4.1 Vocabulary

**associated:** two variables are associated or related to each other if the distribution of one variable is different across the values of the other variable

**explanatory variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that explains changes in the response variable (also known as the **independent** / **predictor variable**). 

**response variable:** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that is impacted by the explanatory variable (also known as the **dependent variable**)

**confounding variable:** a variable related to the explanatory and response variables in such a way that its effects on the response variable cannot be separated from the effects of the explanatory variable---it provides another possible "causal" explanation 


## Section 4.2 New Vocabuary

* block study design
* cause and effect
* control
* double blind
* experiment
* experimental unit
* observational study
* quasi-experiment
* randomized experiment
* treatment


## 

**observational study:** study in which the researchers observe individuals and measure variables of interest, but they do not intervene in order to attempt to influence responses

***Examples:*** Example P.2, where we investigated how long it takes performers to sing the national anthem; Exploration 3.1, where we analyzed whether people turn their heads left or right when they kiss. Researchers recorded "naturally occurring" data.

**experiment:** a study in which the researchers manipulate the explanatory variable and actively assign study participants (or subjects) to treatment groups

***Examples:*** In a clinical drug trial, the researchers assign some participants to try a new drug for allergies and the rest of the participants to a group that takes a similar-looking inactive pill. In a psychology study, participants are assigned to look at print ads or watch television commercials for candidates.


##

**treatment:** the assigned conditions/experimental groups in an experiment

**control:** a do-nothing or placebo treatment in an experiment

**randomized experiment:** a study where experimental units are randomly assigned to two or more treatment conditions and the explanatory variable is actively imposed on the subjects

**block study design (randomized block design):** a study design that begins by forming blocks consisting of individuals that are similar in some way that may be related to the response (a way that could be confounding); random assignment of treatments is then carried out separately with each block

***Example:*** Subjects in an allergy drug experiment are grouped by the severity of their allergies (mild, moderate, severe), then each group is randomized separately into the two treatments.

##

**quasi-experiment:** an experimental study in which researchers manipulate the explanatory variable, but not randomly

***Example:*** Researchers are studying three methods for stopping smoking (cold turkey, patch, and gum), but participants choose for themselves what method they use.

**experimental unit:** what observational units are often called in an experiment

**double blind:** a study design where neither the subjects nor those evaluating the response know which treatment group each subject is in (usually requires a placebo)

**cause and effect:** in a randomized experiment, we can conclude that the explanatory variable is causing the effect (difference or association) we see in the response variable (*the randomization balances possible confounding variables*)


## What Kind of Study?

**randomized experiment:** 

* researchers manipulate the treatments participants receive (i.e., the explanatory variable); may use placebos or blinding
* researchers also randomly assign participants to treatment groups; may use completely random assignment or blocks

**quasi-experiment:** 

* researchers manipulate the treatments participants receive
* researchers **DO NOT** randomly assign participants to groups

**observational study:**

* researchers **DO NOT** manipulate the treatments or randomly assign participants to groups


## Randomness: *Selection* vs. *Assignment*

```

A “randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled experiment” is considered by some to be the gold standard in scientific studies.

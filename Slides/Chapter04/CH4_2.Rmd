* We addressed strength of evidence (significance) in Chapter 1. ✔ ***Great job!***

* We addressed breadth of results (generalization) in Chapter 2. ✔ ***Great job!***

* We addressed the size of an effect (estimation) in Chapter 3. ✔ ***Great job!***

* **Chapter 4 introduces the concept of *causation*, the last of the four pillars.**

## Learning Goals for Chapter 4

Chapter 4 focuses on ***causation***, which is one of the four pillars of inference introduced in Section P.1. 

Overall, the main goal is to explain when and why we can infer cause-and-effect after we determine via a significance test that there is an ***association*** between two variables. 

<hr>

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies. [Section 4.1]

* Explain how studies using random assignment are able to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. [Section 4.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 4.2

* Identify a study as observational or experimental.
* Explain that random assignment gives us the ability to draw cause–effect conclusions because it ensures that treatment groups have similar characteristics.
* Identify whether a study uses random assignment and/or random sampling and the implications of these design decisions on the conclusions that can be drawn.
* Describe what a block study design is and the benefits of using a blocking variable.


## Review Section 4.1 Vocabulary

**<mark>associated</mark> :** two variables are associated or related to each other if the distribution of one variable is different across the values of the other variable

**<mark>explanatory variable</mark> :** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that explains changes in the response variable (also known as the **independent** / **predictor variable**). 

**<mark>response variable</mark> :** if the alternative hypothesis is true, this is the variable that is impacted by the explanatory variable (also known as the **dependent variable**)

**<mark>confounding variable</mark> :** a variable that is related to both the explanatory and response variables in such a way that its effects on the response variable cannot be separated from those of the explanatory variable


## Section 4.2 New Vocabuary

* block study design
* cause and effect
* control
* double blind
* experiment
* experimental unit
* observational study
* quasi-experiment
* randomized experiment
* treatment


## 

**<mark>observational study</mark> :** study in which the researchers observe individuals and measure variables of interest, but they do not intervene in order to attempt to influence responses

***Example 1:*** In Example P.2, we explored how long (in minutes) it takes performers to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, and whether it differs based on variables like performer gender, genre of music, solo versus group performance, or year. 

***Example 3:*** In Exploration 1.4, we considered whether uniform color (red or blue) seems to give a competitor an advantage in the combat sport events at the Olympics. 

***Example 3:*** In Exploration 3.1, we analyzed whether people turn their heads left or right when they kiss. 

In all three of these examples, researchers recorded "naturally occurring" data. They did not influence the process / variables.


##

**<mark>treatment</mark> :** the assigned conditions or experimental groups in an experiment

**<mark>control</mark> :** a "do-nothing" or placebo treatment in an experiment

**<mark>experiment</mark> :** a study in which the researchers manipulate the explanatory variable and actively assign study participants (i.e., subjects or experimental units) to treatment groups

***Examples:*** In a clinical drug trial, the researchers assign some participants to take a new drug for allergies and the rest to take a similar-looking inactive pill (placebo). In a psychological study, some participants are assigned to look at print ads while others watch television commercials for political candidates.

**<mark>randomized experiment</mark> :** a study where experimental units are randomly assigned to two or more treatment conditions and the explanatory variable is actively imposed on the subjects


##

**<mark>block study design (randomized block design)</mark> :** a study design that begins by forming blocks consisting of individuals that are similar in some way that may be related to the response (a way that could be confounding); random assignment of treatments is then carried out separately with each block

***Example:*** The participants in a new allergy drug experiment are first "blocked" (split into groups) by the severity of their allergies (mild, moderate, severe). The individuals in each block are then randomized separately into the new drug and placebo groups, which ensures that all three allergy severities are represented in both experimental groups.

##

**<mark>quasi-experiment</mark> :** an experimental study in which researchers manipulate the explanatory variable, but not randomly

***Example:*** Researchers are studying three methods for stopping smoking (cold turkey, patch, and gum), but participants choose for themselves what method they use.

**<mark>experimental unit</mark> :** what observational units are often called in an experiment

**<mark>double blind</mark> :** a study design where neither the subjects nor those evaluating the response know which treatment group each subject is in (usually requires a placebo)

**<mark>cause and effect</mark> :** in a randomized experiment, we can conclude that the explanatory variable is causing the effect (difference or association) we see in the response variable (*the randomization balances possible confounding variables*)


## What Kind of Study?

**randomized experiment:**

* researchers manipulate the treatments participants receive (i.e., the explanatory variable); may use placebos or blinding
* researchers also randomly assign participants to treatment groups; may use completely random assignment or blocks

**quasi-experiment:** 

* researchers **DO** manipulate treatments participants receive
* researchers **DO NOT** randomly assign participants to groups

**observational study:**

* researchers **DO NOT** manipulate the treatments or randomly assign participants to groups


## Randomness: *Selection* vs. *Assignment*

```

A “randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled experiment” is considered by some to be the gold standard in scientific studies.

## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 5.2 Comparing Two Groups: Categorical Response.

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

See [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) for supplemental readings, videos, assignments, and searchable Glossary of ISI Textbook Vocabulary.


## Recall: The Six-Step Spiral Process

* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we will look at comparing parameters for two groups ($\pi_1, \pi_2$).

* The investigative process is the same; the six-step "spiral" we introduced in Section P.1.

* Now Ho will be written as a *difference* in parameters.

## Learning Goals for Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. In this case, rather than testing a null hypothesis about whether $\pi$ is equal to some value, we will typically have a null of $H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2$ or $H_0: \pi_1 - \pi_2 = 0$ &rarr; there is *no difference*. 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.

<hr>

In Chapter 5 (*not including Section 5.3*), you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample proportions numerically and graphically. [Section 5.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population proportions. [Section 5.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 5.2

In Section 5.2 we will use all our statistical knowledge gained in Chapters 1 through 4 and apply it to a new scenario.

* State Ho and Ha in terms of “no association” versus “there is an association” as well as in terms of comparing probabilities of success for two categories of explanatory variable ($\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$) when exploring the relationship between two categorical variables.

* Implement the 3S strategy: find a statistic, simulate the null distribution, and compute the strength of evidence...

* Describe how to use cards to simulate what outcomes (in terms of difference in conditional proportions and/or relative risk) are to be expected in repeated random assignments, if there is no association between the two variables.


##

* Use the [ISI Two Proportions applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to conduct a simulation of the null hypothesis and be able to read the applet output.

* Find and interpret the standardized statistic and the *p*-value for a test of two proportions.

* Use the 2SD method to find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in long-run proportion of success for two “treatment” groups, and interpret the interval in the context of the study.

* Interpret what it means for the 95% confidence interval for difference in proportions to contain zero.

* State a complete conclusion about the null and alternative hypotheses based on the *p*-value / standardized statistic and the study design, including statistical significance, estimation (confidence interval), generalizability, and causation.


## Section 5.2 New Vocabulary

**standard error:** an estimate for the standard deviation of the null distribution of a statistic

You may also want to review and solidify all of the vocabulary introduced in Section 5.1, especially the supplemental content like percent increased risk and odds ratio.

<hr>

The term *standard error* is not completely new. We mentioned it in Section 2.1 when we explored sampling distributions. Then we encountered it again in Section 3.2 when we introduced 2SD confidence intervals.


## The Two-Proportion Applet

Data will be entered as a two-way table in this new applet.

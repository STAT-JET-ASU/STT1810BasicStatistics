* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we will look at comparing parameters for two groups ($\pi_1, \pi_2$).

* The investigative process is the same; the six-step "spiral" we introduced in Section P.1.

* Now Ho will be written as a *difference* in parameters.

## STEP 1: Ask a Research Question

[Dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_with_dolphins) has been around since roughly the late 1970s. Proponents of DAT claim that interacting with dolphins can help treat a wide variety of mental and physical issues in people, but there is limited scientific evidence to back up its supposed benefits. 

At least one [animal welfare organization](https://awionline.org/content/swim-attractions-dolphin-assisted-therapy) is a strong opponent, claiming that "DAT proponents foster an unproven belief that touching and being close to a dolphin has unique motivational or healthful powers, although studies show that such claims are without scientific merit."

<hr>

**Research Question:** Is swimming with dolphins therapeutic for patients suffering from clinical depression?


## STEP 2: Design a Study / Collect Data

* Researchers recruited 30 participants (ages 18–65) with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate depression. 
* Participants discontinued antidepressants and therapy four weeks prior to and during the experiment.
* All participants went to an island off the coast of Honduras; they were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. 
* Both groups had one hour of swimming and snorkeling each day. One group did so in the presence of bottlenose dolphins and the other group did not. 
* All other conditions for the two groups (e.g., meals, lodging) were identical *except* for the presence of dolphins.
* At the end of two weeks, each subject’s level of depression was evaluated, as it had been at the beginning of the study. 


## Brief Summary of Design

* **study type:** randomized experiment (*possibly single blind*)

* **experimental units:** 30 recruited subjects (ages 18–65) with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate depression

* **explanatory variable (treatment groups):** (1) one hour of swimming/snorkling each day *with* bottlenose dolphins, or <br>(2) one hour of swimming/snorkling each day *without* any dolphins (control group); binary categorical

* **response variable:** whether or not the participants achieved substantial reduction (i.e., improvement) in their depression symptoms, coded as yes or no; binary categorical

* **sample size:** 30 total, with $n_{dolphin}$ = 15 and $n_{control}$ = 15


## The Hypotheses: Two Expressions

**Using the association language of Chapter 4...**

* Ho: Presence of dolphins does not help (i.e., whether or not someone swims with dolphins has *no association* with their depression symptoms).
* Ha: Presence of dolphins helps (i.e., there *is an association* and swimming with dolphins will increase the probability of substantial improvement in depression symptoms).

<hr>

Hypotheses expressed in this form generally would be assessed with a procedure called a $\chi^2$ (chi-square) test, which is covered in Chapter 8 of the textbook. That test can compare two *or more* proportions --- two-way tables that are larger than 2 x 2.


##

**Using parameters, as in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3...**

State hypotheses in words, based on the research question.

* Ho: Probability of substantial improvement after swimming with dolphins is *the same as* probability without dolphins.
* Ha: Probability of substantial improvement after swimming with dolphins is *greater than* probability without dolphins.

<hr>

Now define ***two*** parameters in the context of the problem.

* $\pi_\text{control}$ = probability of experiencing substantial symptom improvement after *not* swimming with dolphins

* $\pi_\text{dolphin}$ = probability of experiencing substantial symptom improvement after swimming with dolphins


## Stating the Hypotheses With Symbols

As before, we can convert the words to symbols.

$$H_0: \pi_\text{dolphin} = \pi_\text{control}$$

$$H_a: \pi_\text{dolphin} > \pi_\text{control}$$

We are really interested in the *difference* between the groups, so the hypotheses can be expressed as a mathematical difference. Algebraically, subtract $\pi_\text{control}$ from both sides, and we get...

$$H_0: \pi_\text{dolphin} - \pi_\text{control} = 0$$

$$H_a: \pi_\text{dolphin} - \pi_\text{control} > 0$$

The observed statistic for this test will be ($\hat{p}_\text{dolphin} - \hat{p}_\text{control}$).


## STEP 3: Explore the Data

Compute conditional proportions of those who demonstrated a "substantial improvement" in symptoms after two weeks, within each treatment group.

| Substantial Improvement? | Dolphin     | Control     | Total       |
|--------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Yes                      | 10 (66.67%) |  3 (20.00%) | 13 (43.33%) |
| No                       |  5 (33.33%) | 12 (80.00%) | 17 (56.67%) |
| Total                    | 15 (100%)   | 15 (100%)   | 30 (100%)   |

<br>

$$\hat{p}_\text{dolphin} - \hat{p}_\text{control} = 0.6667 - 0.2000 = 0.4667$$


## Visualize With a Barplot

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_05_02_01.jpg", dpi = 80)
```

Since the groups are equal in size ($n = 15$ each), a barplot and a mosaic plot would be essentially the same.


## STEP 4: Draw Inferences

We can use the [ISI Two-Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to obtain a simulated *p*-value. The two groups are shuffled together and randomly re-divided between the two treatment groups. From the regrouped data we recalculate the statistic to get a null distribution. Where would the observed statistic be on this plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_05_02_05.jpg", dpi = 120)
```


## Assess Statistical Significance

There were 13 simulated differences $\ge$ 0.4667, so the *p*-value is 0.013, which provides strong evidence against $H_0$.

<hr>

Recall our guidelines for *p*-values from Section 1.2.

| Magnitude               | Guideline for Inference                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| *p*-value > 0.10        | not much evidence against the null hypothesis; Ho is plausible |
| 0.05 < *p*-value ≤ 0.10 | moderate evidence against the null hypothesis                  |
| 0.01 < *p*-value ≤ 0.05 | strong evidence against the null hypothesis                    |
| *p*-value ≤ 0.01        | very strong evidence against the null hypothesis               |


## 

$$\text{z-score} = \frac{\text{stat} - \text{mean of null dist.}}{\text{SD of null dist.}} = \frac{0.4667 - 0}{0.185} = 2.52$$

The standardized score also yields strong evidence against $H_0$.

<hr>

Recall our guidelines for z-scores from Section 1.3.

| Magnitude                | Guideline for Inference                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| between -1.5 and +1.5    | not much evidence against Ho; Ho is plausible |
| below -1.5 or above +1.5 | moderate evidence against Ho                  |
| below -2.0 or above +2.0 | strong evidence against Ho                    |
| below -3.0 or above +3.0 | very strong evidence against Ho               |


## Estimate Magnitude of Difference

Here we will estimate the magnitude of the difference between two parameters with a confidence interval, similar to the way we estimated one parameter. Recall what we learned in Section 3.2 about 2SD confidence intervals.

$$\text{95% CI} = \hat{p} \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p})$$

Now our statistic is $(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ rather than $\hat{p}$, so we substitute it.

$$\text{95% CI} = (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm 2 \times SD(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$$

Recall: $SD(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ is a symbol for "SD of the null distribution of $(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$." We get this value from our simulation.

Important: *Do not* multiply SD by $(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ in the 2SD interval.


##

Use the difference $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ = 0.4667 and simulated SD = 0.185.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_05_02_05.jpg", dpi = 150)
```

$$0.4667 \pm 2 \times 0.185 = 0.4667 \pm 0.370$$

We are 95% confident that the estimated interval (0.097, 0.837) captures the true value of $\pi_\text{dolphin} - \pi_\text{control}$.

Notice that zero is *not* within the interval. This is consistent with rejecting Ho. Zero is not a plausible value for the difference.


## STEP 5: Formulate Conclusions

Recall --- In Section 4.2 we learned about how random selection and random assignment influence conclusions about cause and effect and generalization for a given study.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_04_02_03.jpg", dpi = 105)
```


## Discussion of Findings

This study was a randomized experiment and the data provided strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we can conclude that swimming with dolphins caused a significant improvement in depression symptoms. 

The magnitude of the difference in the probability of patients showing significant improvement is somewhere between 9.7% and 83.7%. *To get a narrower interval, we'd need more data.*

We can also compute the relative risk, which is $\frac{0.6667}{0.2000} = 3.33$.

Participants in the dolphin therapy treatment group were 3.33 times as likely to improve as control subjects.

However, participants were not randomly selected, so we would be limited in our ability to generalize these results.

## Before We Begin…

These slides are meant to accompany the text [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) --- Section 6.1 Comparing Two Groups: Quantitative Response.

*This content does not replace reading the relevant textbook section.* It is for class presentation, review, and reference.

* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we explored differences in proportions for two groups ($\pi_1 - \pi_2$).

* In Chapter 6, we will apply what we learned to assess *quantitative* variables.

* We will compare means of two groups ($\mu_1 - \mu_2$).

## Learning Goals for Chapter 6

Chapter 6 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, where $\mu$ is the population *mean*. A sample mean will be designated with $\bar{x}$. We typically will have a null of $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ or $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (i.e., *no difference*). 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample means numerically and graphically. [Section 6.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population means. [Section 6.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 6.2

* State the null and the alternative hypotheses in terms of “no association” versus “there is an association” as well as in terms of comparing means (i.e., $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$) for an explanatory variable with two categories.

* Implement the 3S strategy to compare two means: find a statistic, simulate, and compute the strength of evidence against observed study results happening by chance alone.

* Describe how to use cards to simulate what outcomes (in terms of difference in means or median) are to be expected in repeated random assignments, if there is no association between the two variables.

* Use the ISI [Multiple Means](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet to conduct a simulation of the null hypothesis and be able to read the applet's output.


##

* Find and interpret the standardized statistic and the *p*-value for a test of two means.

* Use the 2SD method to find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means for two “treatment” groups, and interpret the interval in the context of the study; interpret what it means for the 95% confidence interval for difference in means to contain zero.

* State a complete conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis) based on the *p*-value and/or standardized statistic and the study design, including statistical significance, estimation, generalizability, and causation.


## Section 6.2 New Vocabulary

None! However, you will want to review and be familiar with the vocabulary and methods from previous chapters. Everything we do here builds on the Preliminaries through Chapter 5.

In particular, there are strong similarities between Section 5.2 and Section 6.2. The primary difference is that we are focused on means rather than proportions in Chapter 6.

We also will be using quantitative summaries from Section P.2.

<hr>

Keep in mind the new symbols for this chapter...

* <mark>$\mu$</mark> = population mean (Greek letter mu, pronounced "mew")

* <mark>$\bar{x}$</mark> = sample mean (usually pronounced "x-bar")


## Hypotheses: Comparing Parameters

We will write our hypotheses using parameters, like we did in Chapter 5. We define ***two*** parameters, one for each of the two groups of the explanatory variable.

$\mu_1$ = conditional mean of the quantitative *response variable* in Group 1 of the *explanatory variable*

$\mu_2$ = conditional mean of the quantitative *response variable* in Group 2 of the *explanatory variable*

* $H_0:$ The conditional mean in Group 1 is the same as the conditional mean in Group 2.
* $H_a:$ The conditional mean in Group 1 is (*less than*, *different than*, or *greater than*) the conditional mean in Group 2.


## Stating the Hypotheses Using Symbols

As before, we can convert out hypotheses written words to into more compact statistical symbols.

**Null Hypothesis** (no association/no difference between groups in terms of the mean of the quantitative response variable):

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$

**Alternative Hypothesis** (this depends on the research question):

$$H_a: \mu_1 < \mu_2$$

$$H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

$$H_a: \mu_1 > \mu_2$$


## Writing the Hypotheses as Differences

We are really interested in the *difference* between the groups, so the hypotheses can be expressed as a mathematical difference. Subtract $\mu_2$ from both sides and we get, for example...

$$H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$$

We can do the same for the alternative hypothesis...

$$H_a: \mu_1 -\mu_2 < 0$$

$$H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$$

$$H_a: \mu_1 -\mu_2 > 0$$

The sample difference ($\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$) will be the statistic for the test.


## SD Effects on Strength of Evidence

In earlier chapters we talked about factors that impact the size of the *p*-value in a test of significance. The extremeness of the statistic relative to $H_0$, the sample size, and one-sided versus two-sided tests still matter when we compare means. 

For proportions, variability was a function of $\pi$. For quantitative data there is a separate parameter that impacts the size of the *p*-value: the underlying variability of the data in each group, as measured by the standard deviations. 

If there is more variability in the data (larger group SD values), then the variability of the null distribution will be be greater and the *p*-value will be larger (less significant) as well.

Essentially, if there is more variability *within* each group, then it will be harder to find a difference *between* the groups.


## The [Multiple Means](https://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) Applet

As we did in the *Two Proportions* applet, we will simulate a null distribution by re-shuffling the data between the two groups.

## Before We Begin…

These slides are intended to accompany Section 6.2 Comparing Two Means: Simulation-Based Approach in [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html). 

*This content does not replace reading the textbook section.* It is for class presentation and reference.

* In Chapters 1 through 4, our research questions usually involved a single proportion parameter $\pi$.

* In Chapter 5 we explored differences in proportions for two groups ($\pi_1 - \pi_2$).

* In Chapter 6, we will apply what we learned to assess *quantitative* variables.

* We will compare means of two groups ($\mu_1 - \mu_2$).

## Learning Goals for Chapter 6

Chapter 6 extends what we learned about statistical significance in previous chapters to compare two groups with parameters $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, where $\mu$ is the population *mean*. A sample mean will be designated with $\bar{x}$. We typically will have a null of $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ or $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (i.e., *no difference*). 

We can also estimate the size of difference between $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.

<hr>

In this chapter, you will learn to: 

* Compare two sample means numerically and graphically. [Section 6.1]
* Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population means. [Section 6.2]


## Learning Goals for Section 6.2

* State the null and the alternative hypotheses in terms of “no association” versus “there is an association” as well as in terms of comparing means (i.e., $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$) for an explanatory variable with two categories.

* Implement the 3S strategy to compare two means: find a statistic, simulate, and compute the strength of evidence against observed study results happening by chance alone.

* Describe how to use cards to simulate what outcomes (in terms of difference in means or median) are to be expected in repeated random assignments, if there is no association between the two variables.

* Use the [ISI Multiple Means applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to conduct a simulation of the null hypothesis and be able to read the applet's output.


##

* Find and interpret the standardized statistic and the *p*-value for a test of two means.

* Use the 2SD method to find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means for two “treatment” groups, and interpret the interval in the context of the study; interpret what it means for the 95% confidence interval for difference in means to contain zero.

* State a complete conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis) based on the *p*-value and/or standardized statistic and the study design, including statistical significance, estimation, generalizability, and causation.


## Section 6.2 New Vocabulary

None! However, you will want to review and be familiar with the vocabulary and methods from previous chapters. Everything we do here builds on the Preliminaries through Chapter 5.

<hr>

Also, keep in mind the new symbols for this chapter...

* $\mu$ = population mean (Greek letter mu, pronounced "mew")

* $\bar{x}$ = sample mean (usually pronounced "x-bar")


## Comments on Strength of Evidence

In earlier chapters we talked about factors that impact the size of the *p*-value in a test of significance. The extremeness of the statistic relative to $H_0$, sample size, and one-sided versus two-sided tests still matter in much the same way. 

With quantitative data there is another aspect that impacts size of the *p*-value: the underlying data variability, as measured by the standard deviations in each group. 

If there is more variability in the data (larger SD values in the groups), the variability in the null distribution would be larger and so the *p*-value would be larger as well.

Basically, if there is more variability *within* each group, then it becomes harder to tell a difference *between* the groups.

* Statistical investigations typically include these six steps in some form. 

* These six steps may not always be followed in this exact order, but a good statistical investigation will go through all these steps before completion.

* The findings of one study typically will generate new research questions; that's how science works!

Old Faithful (Yellowstone National Park) erupts around 20 times a day. [According to the National Park Service](https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/geysers-hot-springs/about-old-faithful/), "... eruptions are predicted with a 90 percent confidence rate, within a 10 minute variation," based on duration/height of the previous eruption.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/oldfaithfulsign.jpg", dpi = 175)
```


## STEP 1: Ask a Research Question

The National Park Service's website presents a question that has been asked many times: "I heard Old Faithful isn’t as faithful as it used to be. Is it slowing down?"

Their answer is the information presented on the previous slide about being able to predict eruptions, and also that the number *might* have decreased over time. Perhaps we can better explore this question by examining some data.

**Research Question:** Has there been a change in Old Faithful's eruption pattern between 1978 and 2003? Is it slowing down?

**Note:** We will be looking at the *time between eruptions*. However, if the time between eruptions changes, then so does the overall number or pattern of eruptions per day.


## STEP 2: Design a Study / Collect Data

**type of study:** observational study

**observational units:** individual geyser eruptions

**explanatory variable:** year (binary categorical, 1978 or 2003)

**response variable:** time until the next eruption (quantitative)

**measurement units:** the quantitative variable "time until the next eruption" is measured in minutes

**data:** eruptions that occurred from August 1 to August 8, 1978 (6:00am to midnight), also from the same time interval in 2003

*Choosing the same time period for both years helps to reduce some of the possible confounding variables.*


## STEP 3: Explore the Data

We can explore these data in the ISI [Descriptive Statistics](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) applet.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_06_01_01.jpg", dpi = 150)
```

* What is the shape of each distribution?
* What is the center of each distribution?
* What is the spread (variability) of each distribution?
* Does either distribution have any unusual points/outliers?
* How do the two distributions compare to one another?


## Comparing with Boxplots

The box displays the middle 50% of the distribution; its width  is the IQR. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values in the dataset *that are not outliers*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fig_06_01_02.jpg", dpi = 110)
```

There appear to be two lower outliers in 2003 (the * on the plot). What are the cutoffs for outliers in each of the two years?


##

A data point may be an outlier *relative to the group it belongs to*.

**For 1978:**

$\text{lower quartile} - 1.5 \times IQR = 58 - (1.5 \times 23) = 23.5$ 

$\text{upper quartile} + 1.5 \times IQR = 81 + (1.5 \times 23) = 115.5$ 

*None of the data points in 1978 fall outside these two boundaries.*

<hr>

**For 2003:**

$\text{lower quartile} - 1.5 \times IQR = 87 - (1.5 \times 11) = 70.5$ 

$\text{upper quartile} + 1.5 \times IQR = 98 + (1.5 \times 11) = 114.5$ 

*As the plots show, there are two 2003 data points $< 70.5$ minutes.*


## We Need More Than One Plot

The skewness statistic for 2003 is strongly negatively, largely due to the two low outliers we identified (56 and 58 minutes). If they are removed, then the skewness drops to 0.11. The plot appears roughly symmetric if we disregard outliers. Maybe bimodal?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/skewness03.png", dpi = 150)
```

The 1978 plot is bimodal; the skewness measure is not reliable.

|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-------:|:-----------------:|:------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------------------------:|
| 1978 | 71.1 | 12.9 |    42   |         58        |   75   |         81        |    95   |              23              | 
| 2003 | 91.2 |  8.5 |    56   |         87        |   91   |         98        |   110   |              11              |

<br>

* The measures of center *increased* --- the mean time went up by 20.1 minutes and the median time went up by 14 minutes

* The measures of variability *decreased* --- the SD went down by 4.4 minutes and the IQR went down by 12 minutes

* The five-number summary increased (min, Q<sub>1</sub>, med, Q<sub>3</sub>, max)


## STEP 4: Draw Inferences

In Section 6.2, you will learn how to use simulation to compare two group means to assess statistical significance.

We will be looking at the *difference* between the two groups. The population difference can be written symbolically as $\mu_1 - \mu_2$. For the sample difference, we will use $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$. 

Here we have $\bar{x}_{2003} - \bar{x}_{1978} = 91.2 - 71.1 = 20.1$ minutes. Is this difference just random chance or did Old Faithful's eruption process really change between 1978 and 2003?

The same method could also be used to compare two *medians*. 

Researchers have to be careful about the scope of conclusions they draw from this kind of observational study.


## Think About It ...

Based on the distributions of times between eruptions, in which year would you have preferred to be a tourist waiting to see the next eruption of Old Faithful?

* If you are a tourist who cares most about having a shorter wait for the next eruption, you would tend to prefer 1978. This is because the *average* wait time was about 20 minutes less in 1978 than in 2003. We could also point out here that the *minimum* wait time observed in the data was about 14 minutes less in 1978.

* If your primary concern is being able to predict accurately when the next eruption would occur, then you would tend to prefer 2003. This is because the *variability* in wait times was much smaller in 2003 than in 1978.


## For the Curious...

$$H_0: \mu_{2003} = \mu_{1978} \text{ vs. } H_a: \mu_{2003} > \mu_{1978}$$

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/oldfaithfultest.png", dpi = 150)
```

Based on the *p*-value, what can we conclude about Old Faithful?

<p>Though truthfully, a better name would be Miss Fatty McCatty :)</p>


## Syllabus and Schedule

Shortly we will switch over to the **course syllabus** and talk more about objectives and assessments.

As we review, remember that STT1810 is a 3 credit hour course. The standard expectation for a college course is that you spend **2 to 3** hours outside of class for every **1** credit hour of class.

<p style="text-align: center;">3 + ((2 to 3) &times; 3) = 9 to 12 hours per week</p>

**We really only have 2.5 hours of class time per week**; please don't skip! Be sure to prepare for our limited interaction time.

The prerequisite for STT1810 course is MAT1010, which includes some statistics. If you come into the course with additional stats experience, you ***might*** not need as much time to master course concepts, but do not assume until you try. 


## Your Private Forum

Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your **Private Forum** on AsULearn. This will be new for most of you. 

I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them all semester long and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email (which can turn into a black hole).

## Example 3.1 Can Dogs Sniff Cancer?

Researchers tested a dog named Marine to see whether or not she could detect colorectal cancer via smell. She sniffed breath in 5 bags from 5 different patients, only 1 of which had cancer. Marine chose correctly in 30 of 33 trials ($\hat{p} = 0.909$). 

$H_0: \pi = 0.20$ (Marine is just guessing)

$H_a: \pi > 0.20$ (Marine is doing better than guessing)

```


##

We would reject Ho at the 0.05 level of significance. But, what is Marine's true probability $\pi$ of detecting cancer? We can estimate the value by testing many potential values of $\pi$ on either side of our observed sample proportion $\hat{p} = 0.909$.

| $\pi$ tested in Ho | 0.760 | 0.761 | 0.762 | ...   | 0.973 | 0.974 | 0.975 |
|--------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------|
| two-sided *p*-value| 0.043 | 0.063 | 0.063 | ...   | 0.059 | 0.054 | 0.049 |
| reject Ho?         | Yes   | No    | No    | No    | No    | No    | Yes   |
| plausible $\pi$?   | No    | *YES* | *YES* | *YES* | *YES* | *YES* | No    |

We are 95% confident that Marine's true probability of detecting cancer ($\pi$) is between 0.761 and 0.974.

This is more informative than just stating $\pi > 0.20$ (as in $H_a$).

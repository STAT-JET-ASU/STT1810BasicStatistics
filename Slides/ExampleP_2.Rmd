## Super Bowl National Anthems

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/whitneyssb.png", dpi = 175)
```

How long does it take performers to sing the national anthem? (*People actually bet money on this! But practically speaking, Super Bowl planners would also want to know. Time is $ in the big game.*)


## The Dataset (partial view)

**Table P.2.1** Selected data about Super Bowl performances of the Star Spangled Banner from 2010 to 2019

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/table_p_02_01.jpg", dpi = 105)
```

The [National Anthem dataset](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data/prelim/NationalAnthemTimes.txt) contains data from 1980 to 2019. We can explore the data using the [Descriptive Statistics applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/descstats/Dotplot.htm?hideExtras=2), which also contains updated data for years after 2019.


## Observational Units and Variables

The textbook states, "So, we collected data on the length of the performance of the national anthem preceding the National Football League’s Super Bowl for games from 1980 (Super Bowl 14) to 2019 (Super Bowl 53). Based on the dataset description in the book and **Table P.2.1** ...

* What are the *observational units* in this dataset?

* What are the *categorical* variables in this dataset?

* What are the *quantitative* variables in this dataset?

* What are the units of measurement associated with each of the quantitative variables?

* How can we explore the data to produce useful information?


## How We Describe Distributions

**Categorical Variables**

* frequency / relative frequency

*Summaries based on counting how many times categories occur.*

**Quantitative Variables**

* **shape** (symmetric? skewed? mound-shaped? clusters?)
* **center** (middle or "typical" value/values; mean and median)
* **spread** (more properly called variability; SD and range)
* **unusual observations** (was someone very quick/very slow?)

*Shape, center, and spread describe the pattern of the distribution. Unusual observations are deviations from the pattern.*


## A Less-Than-Ideal Graph

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_01.jpg", dpi = 100)
```

Why is this graph *not* effective for exploring the question "How long does it take performers to sing the national anthem?" 


## What Makes an Effective Graph?

* Let the data tell the story.

* Include appropriate labels for axes, including what is being measured and any associated units of measurement.

* Use an amount of “ink” that is proportional to the information involved. Less is often more!

* Include a title and/or a figure caption.

* Scale any quantitative axes appropriately (e.g., it would be misleading if the horizontal axis in the previous graph had begun at 60 seconds).

Ideally a graph should be a reasonably stand-alone method of conveying information.


## A Better Representation

<hr>
Superbowl National Anthem Lengths (1980 to 2019)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_02.jpg", dpi = 100)
```
<hr>

&nbsp;

* What kind of plot is this?

* What does each dot represent?

* Can you describe the variable distribution?


## 

<hr>
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_03.jpg", dpi = 100)
```
<hr>

* What kind of plot is this?

* What does each bar represent?

* Can you describe the variable distribution?


## What is the Distribution?

* **shape**: relatively symmetric, perhaps bimodal (two peaks)

* **center**: the mean time is 108.0 seconds (1 min and 48 sec)

* **spread**: the SD is 19.2 sec and the range is 156 -- 64 = 92 sec

* **unusual observations**: There are three performances in this dataset that stand out. Neil Diamond appears to have taken an unusually short time at 64 seconds. On the other side of the distribution, Natalie Cole and Alicia Keys both took about 150 seconds (two and a half minutes).

Are there any other variables that can help us explain/predict why national anthem performances at the Super Bowl vary in terms of time?


## Time by Sex*

We can use a categorical variable to provide more information.

<hr>
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_04.jpg", dpi = 100)
```
<hr>

&#42;*We often run into binary gender groupings in research, especially when working with older observations. It may also be true that all performers so far identify solely as male or female. What might be some of the consequences if someone is misclassified?*


## Time by Genre

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_05.jpg", dpi = 105)
```

For which genre might we be able to make the best estimates? Why do you think so?


## Time by Sex and Genre

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_06.jpg", dpi = 100)
```

Are differences between men and women the same in genres?


## Has Time Changed over the Years?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_07.jpg", dpi = 90)
```

To make this kind of plot, we need to use the [Multiple Variables applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/multreg/multreg.html) with the dataset.


## Add Coding by Sex

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_p_02_08.jpg", dpi = 90)
```

Can we detect any other patterns here? Overall, what do these graphs and statistics tell us? What other data would you like to have to help explain the amount of time?

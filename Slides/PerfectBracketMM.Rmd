## What is March Madness?

"March Madness" is the name used to refer to the annual NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, which has been played in one form or another since 1939.

This series of games is arguably one of the most anticipated and watched events in all of sports. 

The American Gaming Association estimated that ~ 68 million American adults would make a total of \$15.5 billion in bets on the 2023 March Madness tournament. This is an increase from about \$10 billion in 2021.

The "average" bet on March Madness is between \$20 and \$50.

Warren Buffett has offered a \$1 billion prize to anyone with a perfect March Madness bracket.

## How Many Games?

Round 1 consists of 32 games.

Round 2 consists of 16 games.

Round 3 consists of 8 games between the "Sweet 16" teams.

Round 4 consists of 4 games between the "Elite 8" teams.

Round 5 consists of 2 games between the "Final 4" teams.

Round 6 consists of 1 game, the Championship!

This produces a total of 63 games for the standard bracket. 

If we include the four play-in games that precede Round 1, then we would have a total of 67 games.


## Probability of a Perfect Bracket

What is the probability of winning Buffett's prize? That depends in part on the person's ability to predict single-game winners.

An [article](https://www.ncaa.com/webview/news%3Abasketball-men%3Abracketiq%3A2023-03-16%3Aperfect-ncaa-bracket-absurd-odds-march-madness-dream) on the NCAA's web site explores this question. Among their comments...

Here's the TL/DR version of the odds of a perfect NCAA bracket:

* 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (if you just guess / flip a coin)
* 1 in 120.2 billion (if you know a little something about b-ball)

So what probability of choosing a game winner is implied by "if you know a little something about basketball"? Let's explore.

*Currently, the best computer models guess right ~ 75% of the time.*


## Guessing a Perfect Bracket

What if someone is just randomly guessing the winner of every game? They would have a 50% chance of correctly choosing the winner of each game. If we assume the games are independent of each other, like flips of a coin...

probability = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} ...$ (63 times, one for each game)

probability = $(0.5)^{63} = 0.0000000000000000001084202$

Or, if you prefer, $1$ in $9,223,372,036,854,775,808$&mdash;which is roughly a $1$ in $9$ *quintillion* chance.

For 67 games, it would be $(0.5)^{67}$&mdash;roughly $1$ in $147$ quintillion.

## Better than Guessing?

What if somebody can do better than guessing? To simplify the model, we will assume their chance is the same for every game. What $\pi$ seems to equate to "know a little something"?

| Single-Game        | Probability of Having a Perfect Bracket for 63 Games                                         |
|:------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| $\pi = 0.6$        | 1 in `r format(round(1/(0.6^(63))), scientific = F, big.mark = ",")` ~ 1 in 95 *trillion*    |
| $\pi = 0.667$      | 1 in `r format(round(1/(0.667^(63))), scientific = F, big.mark = ",")` ~ 1 in 120.2 *billion*|
| $\pi = 0.7$        | 1 in `r format(round(1/(0.7^(63))), scientific = F, big.mark = ",")` ~ 1 in 5.7 *billion*    |
| $\pi = 0.8$        | 1 in `r format(round(1/(0.8^(63))), scientific = F, big.mark = ",")` ~ 1 in 1.3 *million*    |
| $\pi = 0.9$        | 1 in `r format(round(1/(0.9^(63))), scientific = F, big.mark = ",")` ~ a legitimate shot?    |


## Additional Ideas

If the probability of guessing the winner for each game is not a constant, but the games are independent, then we can multiply the 63 individual game probabilities together to find the perfect bracket probability, like we showed when they were all 1/2.

If the 63 games are not all independent of one another, we can still calculate the probability of a perfect bracket, but *conditional* probabilities are more involved than simple multiplication. 

What variables do you think might influence the probability that a given team wins their game against a given opponent?

The longest verifiable streak of correct picks as of March 2023 (49 games---just into the Sweet 16) happened in 2019. What is the probability of that achievement?

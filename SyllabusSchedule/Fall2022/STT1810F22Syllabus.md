#### **Bulletin Description**  

STT1810 is an introduction to statistical problem solving. Topics include organization and presentation of data; measures of location, variation, and association; the normal distribution, sampling distributions, and statistical inference. Emphasis will be on conceptual understanding and interpretation of results rather than theoretical development. Statistical software will be utilized in the analysis of data and in the development of statistical and probabilistic concepts. STT 1810 is not open to students with credit for STT 2810, STT 2820, STT 3850, or STT 4811. (NUMERICAL DATA; COMPUTER; *GEN ED: Quantitative Literacy*)

Prerequisite: MAT 1010 or higher. Demonstrated readiness for college-level math. 

This course is 100% web-based and will hold synchronous class meetings using Zoom, so you should be comfortable using a computer and must have reliable access to a computer and internet connection. 

#### **Course Objectives**

1. Students will demonstrate effective use of selected descriptive statistics methods.
2. Students will demonstrate effective use of selected inferential statistics methods.
3. Students will effectively communicate using statistical frameworks and vocabulary.
4. Students will use statistical thinking to evaluate scholarly research and popular media.
5. Students will demonstrate preparedness for continued statistics coursework or research.

Participation in STT 1810 is also designed to meet the following [General Education Learning Goals]((https://universitycollege.appstate.edu/programs/general-education-program/program-goals)).

* Goal 1. Thinking Critically and Creatively
* Goal 2. Communicating Effectively

#### **Class Meetings**

This is a synchronous 100% online class. We will meet at the times below via Zoom.

* Section 102: Class is Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00am to 12:15pm
* Section 103: Class is Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30pm to 01:45pm

As stated in the ASU Undergraduate Bulletin, students are expected to attend all synchronous course meetings, whether in-person or virtual. Any student who is absent for any reason is completely responsible for all announcements and material covered during class.

Our "face to face" time is limited to 2.5 hours per week, so it is important that your attention not be unnecessarily divided during class. There are some additional guidelines to help facilitate the "face-to-face" learning experience for you and your peers.

* Be ready to participate when class starts (e.g., notebooks and materials out).
* Do not pack up at the end of class until I am finished teaching and dismiss you.
* Put away phones. Do not text, check email, surf the web, or do other coursework.

#### **Student Help Hours** 

* Monday: 12:20pm to 2:00pm
* Tuesday: no scheduled hours
* Wednesday: 11:00am to 12:30pm and 4:30pm to 6:00pm
* Thursday: no scheduled hours
* Friday: this varies from week to week
* *I may schedule student appointments at other times, if needed.* 

I will be available on Zoom during all posted office hours. You may drop in or [book an appointment](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU0zQUk4blgtNW44fGRlZmF1bHR8Y2EyZDZmYTMxNmZjMWEwMjdiMzE0ZjQ1MmEwNDFjMmE). Appointments take priority over drop-ins in terms of time. You may find yourself in a waiting room if I am interacting with an appointment, but I *will* get to you.

**Title IX Information Disclosure:** I care about you inside and outside of my classroom, and I want you to get the help and support you need. Given my role as an instructor at Appalachian State University, you should be informed about your choices regarding disclosure of sensitive information. If a student tells an instructor that they have experienced an act of interpersonal violence, then that faculty member is **required** to report it to the campus Title IX Coordinator. If you prefer to talk with someone who can keep your information confidential, I recommend the Counseling Center (828-262-3180, https://counseling.appstate.edu/). They also offer walk-in and after-hours coverage.

**Other Assistance:** I urge any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, to contact the Dean of Students (https://deanofstudents.appstate.edu/) for assistance and support. The Mountaineer Food Hub & Free Store (https://sustain.appstate.edu/initiatives/food-pantry/) is a free resource with pantry and personal care items. See the **Campus Resources for Students** link on our AsULearn age for more resources available to ASU students.

#### **Communication**  

* I will use the **Course Announcements** forum on our AsULearn site to send out announcements and course information. You are responsible for knowing the content of all postings, in addition to anything I say in class. 
* **Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your Private Forum on AsULearn.** I prefer this method because it stores all course-related messages and exchanges in a place where we can easily access them throughout the semester. Like e-mail, you can include images and attachments. These forums keep my class communications separate from the rest of my email and provide notifications in AsULearn&mdash;a system I have found to be more effective over the past few years. 
* Monday to Thursday, I will check Private Forums for messages at least once per day between the hours of 10am and 7pm. Fridays will vary, depending on whether I am doing site visits for a research project. I may check more than once on weekdays. I typically will check at least once on Saturdays, depending on my weekend schedule. Please do not expect replies on Sundays.

#### **Assessment & Grading**

##### **▷ Text & Technology**

The course textbook is ***Introduction to Statistical Investigations (2nd edition)*** by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. You will receive a code via ASU's textbook rental system that will allow you to access the book electronically via WileyPLUS. All course materials will be found either on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) (our primary course hub) or [WileyPLUS](https://www.wileyplus.com/).

To participate in class/learning activities, and to complete assignments, you will need access to an updated electronic device on which you can access Zoom, WileyPLUS, the simulation applets that accompany the textbook, and other electronic materials. The applets can be used on a cell phone, tablet, or computer, though a tablet or computer is better. 

##### **▷ Assessment Items**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes software and data. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and formative / summative assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" of statistics to effectively demonstrate your knowledge. 

* **Attendance (5%):**  This is a active-learning and discussion-based class, so attendance and engaged participation is required. As per [ASU's attendance policy](https://odr.appstate.edu/attendance), "class attendance is an important part of a student’s educational experience. Students are expected to attend every meeting of their classes and are responsible for class attendance." There are only 30 class periods for Sections 102 and 103 of this course during the Fall 2022 semester. Thus, one class period is 3.33% of the class and three class periods is 10%. 

* **Class Preparation (10%):** For each section, there will be a Class Prep "Quiz" to prepare you for the exploration that will be covered during class. These will be submitted through AsULearn. You will get full credit (1) if you earn 75% or more of the points. Otherwise you will get no credit (0). If you do not get credit on the original assignment, a second chance opportunity will open up that will allow you to try again. In this case, you must earn 85% of the points to get credit. Some questions will require manual grading, so you will not immediately see your full score when you submit your work. You may have some question types that allow multiple attempts.

* **Practice Problems (10%):** These  WileyPLUS assignments are primarily short, *formative* assessments on the current materials, designed to reinforce recently-introduced concepts and help you figure out where you need to review or seek additional help. On each assignment, you will get two tries per question. Late submissions are allowed, but result in reduced points. You will get full credit (1) if you earn 75% or more of the points. You will get half-credit if you earn 50% to 75% of the points. If you earn less than 50% of the points, you will get no credit (0). Points earned will be calculated in WileyPLUS; credit will be manually entered into AsULearn as 0, 0.5, or 1.

* **Chapter Homework (20%):** These WileyPLUS assignments are primarily *summative* assessments intended to show me (and you) what you have learned. On each assignment, you will get three tries per question. The first two attempts give full credit for correct answers; the third attempt has a 10% reduction. Late submissions are allowed, but result in reduced points. Credit earned on these HW assignments will be the number of points earned. Points earned will be calculated in WileyPLUS and manually entered into AsULearn.

* **Chapter Investigations (15%):** At the end of each chapter, you will complete a guided investigation that applies the material in a different context. These assignments complement the Chapter HW and require you to integrate concepts and explain in your own words. These will be submitted through AsULearn and scored using a rubric. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

* **Research Articles (10%):** You will read three research articles and answer questions about the statistical investigative cycle presented in the article. These assignments integrate content from more than one chapter and will be submitted through AsULearn.

* **Midterm Exam (15%):** This exam is a *summative* assessment of what you have learned across several chapters. Problems will be similar in style and content to other course assessments. Conceptual understanding and explanation will be a part of the exam. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

* **Final Exam (15%): ** This exam is a cumulative *summative* assessment of what you have learned across the entire course. Problems will be similar in style and content to the Midterm Exam. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

There will be no makeup exams in this course. If you miss the Midterm Exam, your Final Exam grade will count for both. 

##### **▷ Grading Scale** 

This course will use the standard 10-point +/- grading scale (93--100 = A, 90--92 = A--, 87--89 = B+, etc.) to determine final grades. I do not round up. Accommodations *may* be made for documented extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing work early/on time. Grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they are complete and accurate. Contact the instructor via your Private Forum or office hours if you have questions.   

##### **▷ Sharing Materials**

All course materials may be subject to intellectual property protections under applicable law and regulation, including videos and slides. They are for the sole use of students enrolled in this class. Students **may** copy or record materials for personal use and study in the context of this class, but students do **not** have permission to share any class materials in any manner, on any platform, without the prior express permission of the faculty member teaching this course. When in doubt, *ask first*.

##### **▷ Academic Integrity**

Appalachian's [Academic Integrity Code](https://academicintegrity.appstate.edu/) is designed to create an atmosphere of trust, respect, fairness, honesty, and responsibility. All members of the ASU community are responsible for promoting an ethical learning environment. Students attending ASU agree to abide by the following:

* Students will not lie, cheat, or steal to gain academic advantage.
* Students will oppose every instance of academic dishonesty.

By submitting work under your name, you are attesting that you have abided by the Academic Integrity Code. Violations of Academic Integrity will be treated very seriously. [Penalties](https://academicintegrity.appstate.edu/pagesmith/13) can include a reduced grade for the assignment or course, course, academic probation, or expulsion.

#### **Student Expectations**

##### **▷ Engage with the Content**

Appalachian students are expected to make engagement with courses their first priority. Be proactive and take charge of your own learning! If you have not read/watched assigned materials or attempted problems and online programming modules before coming to class or office hours, you likely will be confused, feel lost, and have a terrible experience in this course. I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN! Each of you has the capability to succeed. However, sometimes we must change certain behaviors, study habits, and/or emotional reactions. In this course, you will be challenged with concepts and problems you have never seen before. I do not expect you to be able to understand them all immediately. A critical first step in learning new material is seeing what you can do on your own. This may feel uncomfortable and frustrating. Success in data science is not based on whether it "comes naturally" to you or whether a topic seems “clear” the first time you are introduced to it. Instead, success is about learning to use mistakes and material we may be struggling with in order to grow. You will see that even I struggle at times; there is always something new to learn, especially when it comes to computing in R. Each time we get stuck, it teaches us something about the problem we are working on and leads us to develop greater skill and better understanding of the content. 

##### **▷ Communicate with Others**

Knowing what you can do on your own is important, but in the real world, people are not generally expected to work alone. In fact, teamwork is frequently required to achieve good outcomes. You will be expected to share with your peers to help develop your own and their proficiencies. I encourage you to talk to me and to your classmates in person or electronically even when you are not specifically assigned by me to do so. Asking questions and explaining things to others is one of the best ways to improve your understanding. Together we will create an environment in which everyone is respectful to one another and feels comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and offering good guesses. Explore concepts and write out your thinking in a way that can be shared with others. Try everything that is asked of you, even if only to say, “I do not understand such and such” or “I am stuck here.” Be as specific as possible. *Consider. Conjecture*. I will try to give you hints and direction to help you understand. At times though, to encourage the exploration process, I may direct you to rethink a problem and then come back to discuss it with me  afterwards. This occurs when I believe that the struggle to understand is imperative for your deep understanding.  

##### **▷ Invest Appropriate Time**

As per the University-wide Statement on Student Engagement with Courses (see University Policies below), you should expect to spend 2-3 hours on course work outside class for every hour you spend in class. **STT 2860 is a 3-credit course, which means course work and assessments are structured around 3 hours of class attendance and 6-9 hours of outside work per week.** All students are different, but I have used the [Rice Course Workload Estimator](https://cte.rice.edu/workload) and other tools to help estimate how long assigned course activities will take. If you find that you are spending fewer hours than these guidelines suggest, you can probably improve your understanding and grade by studying more. If you are consistently spending more hours than these guidelines suggest, you may be studying inefficiently; in that case, you should come see me to help identify where you can make some changes. Many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this (or any) course. Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself to maximize your learning and achievement. 

##### **▷ Additional Class Policies**

This course conforms to all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance. The details of these policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.

As per [AppalachianState University](https://diversity.appstate.edu/) and the [Department of Mathematical Sciences Statement on Diversity and Inclusiveness](https://mathsci.appstate.edu/diversity), I intend this class is to be a welcoming environment where everyone can learn and explore in order to achieve their full potential. As such, we all need to be respectful to each other in all interactions, regardless of gender, political party, race, religion, sexuality, disability, etc. This includes others' choices about COVID precautions, such as masks and social distancing. Activities that distract or disrupt your fellow students or the instructor may result in a lowered grade. First offenses typically will be dealt with by the instructor. Subsequent or serious behavior issues will be referred to the **Office of Student Conduct** (https://studentconduct.appstate.edu/).

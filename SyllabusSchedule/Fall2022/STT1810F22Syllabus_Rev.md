#### **Assessment & Grading**

This addendum updates the assessment items.

##### **▷ Assessment Items**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes software and data. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and formative / summative assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" of statistics to effectively demonstrate your knowledge. 

* **Attendance (5%):**  This is a active-learning and discussion-based class, so attendance and engaged participation is required. As per [ASU's attendance policy](https://odr.appstate.edu/attendance), "class attendance is an important part of a student’s educational experience. Students are expected to attend every meeting of their classes and are responsible for class attendance." There are only 30 class periods for Sections 102 and 103 of this course during the Fall 2022 semester. Thus, one class period is 3.33% of the class and three class periods is 10%. 

* **Class Preparation (10%):** For each section, there will be a Class Prep "Quiz" to prepare you for the exploration that will be covered during class. These will be submitted through AsULearn. You will get full credit (1) if you earn 75% or more of the points. Otherwise you will get no credit (0). If you do not get credit on the original assignment, a second chance opportunity will open up that will allow you to try again. In this case, you must earn 85% of the points to get credit. Some questions will require manual grading, so you will not immediately see your full score when you submit your work. You may have some question types that allow multiple attempts.

* **Practice Problems (10%):** These  WileyPLUS assignments are primarily short, *formative* assessments on the current materials, designed to reinforce recently-introduced concepts and help you figure out where you need to review or seek additional help. On each assignment, you will get two tries per question. Late submissions are allowed, but result in reduced points. You will get full credit (1) if you earn 75% or more of the points. You will get half-credit if you earn 50% to 75% of the points. If you earn less than 50% of the points, you will get no credit (0). Points earned will be calculated in WileyPLUS; credit will be manually entered into AsULearn as 0, 0.5, or 1.

* **Chapter Homework (20%):** These WileyPLUS assignments are primarily *summative* assessments intended to show me (and you) what you have learned. On each assignment, you will get three tries per question. The first two attempts give full credit for correct answers; the third attempt has a 10% reduction. Late submissions are allowed, but result in reduced points. Credit earned on these HW assignments will be the number of points earned. Points earned will be calculated in WileyPLUS and manually entered into AsULearn.

* **Chapter Investigations (15%):** At the end of some chapters, you will complete a guided investigation that applies the material in a different context. These assignments complement the Chapter HW and require you to integrate concepts and explain in your own words. These will be submitted through AsULearn and scored using a rubric. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

* **Midterm Exam (20%):** This exam is a *summative* assessment of what you have learned across several chapters. Problems will be similar in style and content to other course assessments. Conceptual understanding and explanation will be a part of the exam. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

* **Final Exam (20%): ** This exam is a cumulative *summative* assessment of what you have learned across the entire course. Problems will be similar in style and content to the Midterm Exam. More information will be provided on AsULearn.

There will be no makeup exams in this course. If you miss the Midterm Exam, your Final Exam grade will count for both. 

##### **▷ Grading Scale** 

This course will use the standard 10-point +/- grading scale (93--100 = A, 90--92 = A--, 87--89 = B+, etc.) to determine final grades. I do not round up. Accommodations *may* be made for documented extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing work early/on time. Grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they are complete and accurate. Contact the instructor via your Private Forum or office hours if you have questions.

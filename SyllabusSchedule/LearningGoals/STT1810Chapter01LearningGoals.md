The course textbook for STT 1810 is [***Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition***](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. Students have access to the textbook online via [**WileyPLUS**](https://www.wileyplus.com/). We will cover the following sections in STT 1810.

### CHAPTER 01 *Significance: How Strong is the Evidence?*

#### **Section 1.1** Introduction to Chance Models

**Chapter Learning Goal: Use the chance model to determine whether an observed statistic is unlikely to occur.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Recognize the difference between parameters and statistics.
* Describe how to use coin tossing to simulate outcomes from a chance model of a random choice between two events.
* Use the [ISI One Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to carry out a coin tossing simulation.
* Identify whether or not the results of a study are statistically significant and whether or not a chance model is a plausible explanation for the data.
* Implement the 3S strategy: find a statistic, simulate results from a chance model, and determine strength of evidence.
* Differentiate between saying a chance model is plausible and a chance model is the correct explanation for observed data (i.e., whether or not we have "proven" a result).

#### **Section 1.2** Measuring the Strength of Evidence

**Chapter Learning Goal: Calculate and interpret a $p$-value, and state the strength of evidence it provides against the null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Use appropriate symbols for parameter and statistic.
* State the null and the alternative hypotheses in words and in terms of the symbol $\pi$, the long-run proportion.
* Explain how to conduct a simulation using a null hypothesis probability that is not 50-50.
* Use the [ISI One Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to obtain the $p$-value after carrying out an appropriate simulation.
* Anticipate the null distribution's center and how it changes based on using proportion or count as the statistic.
* Interpret the $p$-value and explain why a smaller $p$-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis and null hypothesis based on the $p$-value.

#### **Section 1.3** Alternative Measure of Strength of Evidence

**Chapter Learning Goal: Calculate a standardized statistic for a single proportion and evaluate the strength of evidence it provides against a null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Find a standardized statistic from the observed proportion of “successes” in the data, the hypothesized mean of the null distribution (i.e., *the value of the parameter that is specified in Ho*), and standard deviation (SD) of the null distribution as produced by the [ISI One Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) (i.e., simulation).
* Interpret a standardized statistic.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis Ho) based on the magnitude of the standardized statistic.
* Recognize that standardizing the statistic is an alternative measure of strength of evidence.

#### **Section 1.4** What Impacts Strength of Evidence?

**Chapter Learning Goal: Describe how the distance of the observed statistic from the parameter value specified by the null hypothesis, sample size, and one- vs. two-sided tests affect the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is smaller when the observed proportion of successes is farther away from the hypothesized value of the long-run proportion of successes.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is smaller when the sample size is larger.
* Recognize when a two-sided test / alternative hypothesis is suggested by the research question.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is larger when the alternative hypothesis is two-sided.

The course textbook for STT 1810 is [***Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition***](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. Students have access to the textbook online via [**WileyPLUS**](https://www.wileyplus.com/). We will cover the following sections in STT 1810.

### CHAPTER 03 *Estimation: How Large is the Effect?*

**Chapter Learning Goal: Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the range of plausible values technique.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

#### **Section 3.1** Statistical Inference: Confidence Intervals

* Complete multiple two-sided tests of significance, using the same value for the sample proportion but changing the value under the null hypothesis, and obtain an interval of plausible values for the population parameter.
* Interpret an interval of plausible values as estimating the population parameter and as a confidence interval.
* Based on the results of a test of significance, infer whether or not a value is in the confidence interval and vice versa.

#### **Section 3.2** 2SD and Theory-Based Confidence Intervals for a Single Proportion

**Chapter Learning Goal: Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single population proportion using the 2SD method.**

* Compute a confidence interval for a proportion written in terms of its endpoints vs. a confidence interval written in terms of center plus or minus a margin of error.
* Approximate a 95% confidence interval for a proportion by using the 2SD method.

#### **Section 3.4** Factors That Affect the Width of a Confidence Interval

**Chapter Learning Goal: Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval.**

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the confidence level increases, the width of the confidence interval increases.
* Apply the idea that the confidence level of an interval corresponds to its coverage probability (*the proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter value across many, many random samples*) in the interpretation of confidence intervals.
* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample size increases, the width of the resulting confidence interval decreases.
* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample proportion gets farther from 0.5, standard error decreases and thus a resulting confidence interval will be narrower.
* Recognize that statistical significance on its own does not imply evidence of a large difference from Ho. This issue is especially relevant with large sample sizes. 
* Know that $p$-values address statistical significance while CIs help assess the plausible size of the parameter.

### CHAPTER 04 *Causation: Can We Say What Caused the Effect*

#### **Section 4.1** Association and Confounding

**Chapter Learning Goal: Identify confounding variables in observational studies.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Calculate and interpret conditional proportions.
* Interpret conditional proportions as to whether they give any indication of an association between the explanatory and response variables.
* Identify which variable is the explanatory variable and which is response in a study involving two variables.
* Identify potential confounding variables and explain how they provide an alternative explanation for the observed association between the explanatory variable and the response variable.
* Draw a diagram to show how the confounding variable provides an alternative explanation for the observed association between the explanatory variable and the response variable.

#### **Section 4.2** Observational Studies Versus Experiments

**Chapter Learning Goal: Explain how studies using random assignment are able to draw cause-and-effect conclusions.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Identify a study as observational or experimental.
* Explain that random assignment gives us the ability to draw causeâ€“effect conclusions because it ensures that treatment groups have similar characteristics.
* Identify whether a study uses random assignment and/or random sampling and the implications of these design decisions on the conclusions that can be drawn.
* Describe what a block study design is and the benefits of using a blocking variable.

The course textbook for STT 1810 is [***Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition***](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. Students have access to the textbook online via [**WileyPLUS**](https://www.wileyplus.com/). We will cover the following sections in STT 1810.

### CHAPTER 05 *Comparing Two Proportions*

#### **Section 5.1** Comparing Two Groups: Categorical Response

**Chapter Learning Goal: Compare two sample proportions numerically and graphically.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Organize counts into a two-way table, when data are available on two categorical variables for the same set of observational units.
* Calculate conditional proportion of successes, for different categories of the explanatory variable, and use these conditional proportions to decide whether there is preliminary evidence of an association between the explanatory and response variables.
* Create a segmented bar chart or mosaic plot to display data available on two categorical variables for the same set of observational units.
* Calculate and interpret relative risk (also called risk ratio).

#### **Section 5.2** Comparing Two Proportions: Simulation-Based Approach

**Chapter Learning Goal: Carry out a simulation-based analysis to investigate the difference between two population proportions.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* State Ho and Ha in terms of “no association” versus “there is an association” as well as in terms of comparing probabilities of success for two categories of explanatory variable ($\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$) when exploring the relationship between two categorical variables.
* Implement the 3S strategy: find a statistic, simulate the null distribution, and compute the strength of evidence...
* Describe how to use cards to simulate what outcomes (in terms of difference in conditional proportions and/or relative risk) are to be expected in repeated random assignments, if there is no association between the two variables.

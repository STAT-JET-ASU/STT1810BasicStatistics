### TEXTBOOK CITATION & LINKS

The course textbook for STT 1810 is [***Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition***](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. Students have access to the textbook online via [**WileyPLUS**](https://www.wileyplus.com/). Each chapter has several broad learning goals, which are broken down into section learning goals that build to the broader goals. We will cover the following sections in STT 1810.

### CHAPTER 01 *Significance: How Strong is the Evidence?*

#### **Section 1.1** Introduction to Chance Models

**Chapter Learning Goal: Use the chance model to determine whether an observed statistic is unlikely to occur.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Recognize the difference between parameters and statistics.
* Describe how to use coin tossing to simulate outcomes from a chance model of a random choice between two events.
* Use the [ISI One Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) to carry out a coin tossing simulation.
* Identify whether or not the results of a study are statistically significant and whether or not a chance model is a plausible explanation for the data.
* Implement the 3S strategy: find a statistic, simulate results from a chance model, and determine strength of evidence.
* Differentiate between saying a chance model is plausible and a chance model is the correct explanation for observed data (i.e., whether or not we have "proven" a result).

#### **Section 1.2** Measuring the Strength of Evidence

**Chapter Learning Goal: Calculate and interpret a $p$-value, and state the strength of evidence it provides against the null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Use appropriate symbols for parameter and statistic.

* Anticipate the null distribution's center and how it changes based on using proportion or count as the statistic.
* Interpret the $p$-value and explain why a smaller $p$-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis and null hypothesis based on the $p$-value.

#### **Section 1.3** Alternative Measure of Strength of Evidence

**Chapter Learning Goal: Calculate a standardized statistic for a single proportion and evaluate the strength of evidence it provides against a null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Find a standardized statistic from the observed proportion of “successes” in the data, the hypothesized mean of the null distribution (i.e., *the value of the parameter that is specified in Ho*), and standard deviation (SD) of the null distribution as produced by the [ISI One Proportion applet](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi2nd/ISIapplets2021.html) (i.e., simulation).
* Interpret a standardized statistic.
* State a conclusion about the alternative hypothesis (and null hypothesis Ho) based on the magnitude of the standardized statistic.
* Recognize that standardizing the statistic is an alternative measure of strength of evidence.

#### **Section 1.4** What Impacts Strength of Evidence?

**Chapter Learning Goal: Describe how the distance of the observed statistic from the parameter value specified by the null hypothesis, sample size, and one- vs. two-sided tests affect the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is smaller when the observed proportion of successes is farther away from the hypothesized value of the long-run proportion of successes.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is smaller when the sample size is larger.
* Recognize when a two-sided test / alternative hypothesis is suggested by the research question.
* Anticipate and explain why, when everything else remains the same, the $p$-value is larger when the alternative hypothesis is two-sided.

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Identify parameters (long-run proportion) and statistics (sample proportion) in a statistical study.
* Identify which statistics (proportions) and graphs (bar graph) are appropriate for categorical variables, construct graphs and calculate statistics with use of technology, and interpret appropriately.
* Identify the (finite) population and the sample in a statistical study.
* Identify whether a sampling method is likely to be biased and explain the potential impact.
* Describe how to select a random sample and recognize that one advantage of a random sample is that it is likely to be representative of the population regardless of sample size.

#### **Section 3.1** Statistical Inference: Confidence Intervals

* Complete multiple two-sided tests of significance, using the same value for the sample proportion but changing the value under the null hypothesis, and obtain an interval of plausible values for the population parameter.
* Interpret an interval of plausible values as estimating the population parameter and as a confidence interval.
* Based on the results of a test of significance, infer whether or not a value is in the confidence interval and vice versa.

#### **Section 3.2** 2SD and Theory-Based Confidence Intervals for a Single Proportion

* Compute a confidence interval for a proportion written in terms of its endpoints vs. a confidence interval written in terms of center plus or minus a margin of error.
* Approximate a 95% confidence interval for a proportion by using the 2SD method.

#### **Section 3.4** Factors That Affect the Width of a Confidence Interval

**Chapter Learning Goal: Identify how factors (confidence level, sample size, SD) affect the width of the confidence interval.**

* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the confidence level increases, the width of the confidence interval increases.
* Apply the idea that the confidence level of an interval corresponds to its coverage probability (*the proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter value across many, many random samples*) in the interpretation of confidence intervals.
* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample size increases, the width of the resulting confidence interval decreases.
* Recognize that all other things being equal, as the sample proportion gets farther from 0.5, standard error decreases and thus a resulting confidence interval will be narrower.
* Recognize that statistical significance on its own does not imply evidence of a large difference from Ho. This issue is especially relevant with large sample sizes. 
* Know that $p$-values address statistical significance while CIs help assess the plausible size of the parameter.

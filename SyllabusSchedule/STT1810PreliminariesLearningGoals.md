The course textbook for STT 1810 is [***Introduction to Statistical Investigations, 2nd Edition***](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/index2nd.html) by Nathan Tintle, Beth Chance, George Cobb, Allan Rossman, Soma Roy, Todd Swanson, and Jill VanderStoep. Students have access to the textbook online via [**WileyPLUS**](https://www.wileyplus.com/). We will cover the following sections in STT 1810.

### PRELIMINARIES *Introduction to Statistical Investigations*

#### **Section P.1** Introduction to the Six-Step Method

**Chapter Learning Goal:: Use the six-step statistical investigation method to carry out any statistical study.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Describe how the six steps of a statistical investigation (the "Six-Step Method") apply to a particular statistical study.
* Think of / write research questions that could be investigated with a statistical study.
* Identify observational units / variables in a statistical study.
* Classify variables as categorical or quantitative.

#### **Section P.2** Exploring Data

**Chapter Learning Goal: Describe distributions of quantitative variables.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Describe the distribution of a quantitative variable in terms of shape, center, variability, and unusual observations.
* Compare shapes between two or more distributions that are displayed in dotplots or histograms.
* Compare the centers between two or more distributions that are displayed in dotplots or histograms.
* Compare the variability between two or more distributions in dotplots or histograms.
* Interpret graphs that contain a color-coded third variable.
* Make predictions about centers/means, and about variability / standard deviations, based on the context of the variable.

#### **Section P.3** Exploring Random Processes

**Chapter Learning Goal: Use simulations to explore and understand probabilities.**

**Section Learning Goals:**

* Write an interpretation of a probability as a long-run proportion.
* Describe how to use physical devices such as coins and cards to simulate a random process.
* Conduct a simulation analysis to approximate a probability.
* Describe the effect of increasing the number of repetitions in a simulation analysis on the accuracy of an approximate probability (or a simulated probability distribution).
* Select an appropriate decision involving a random process, based on probabilities and/or simulation results.
